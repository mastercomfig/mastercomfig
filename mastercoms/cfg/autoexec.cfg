// ~~~~ Mastercoms's TF2 Config ~~~~
// Version: v3.4.0 | August 13 2017

// Launch Options:
// -novid -nojoy -noff -nohltv -high
//
// -novid : disables Valve startup logo
// -nojoy : stops Joystick system from starting up
// -nosteamcontroller : disable Steam controller system
// -noff : disables rumble system
// -nohltv : disables Source TV
// -high : runs TF2 with High priority, which runs tasks ASAP, but not before OS level tasks, more FPS and responsiveness
// -nouserclip : disables user clip planes and enables fast clipping, more FPS
// -softparticlesdefaultoff : disable depth blending for particles and sprites, more FPS
// -reuse :  allow network sockets to be reused when busy (sets SO_REUSEADDR), better network performance
// -usetcp : allow usage of TCP where it would be more optimal than UDP, better network performance
// -primarysound : Don't use a secondary sound buffer, small FPS boost/more reliable sound
// -snoforceformat : Skips force setting of sound buffer format, small FPS boost/more reliable sound
// -limitvsconst : limits the hardware vertex shader constants to 256, small FPS boost

// Extras:
// -noforcemaccel -noforcemparms -noforcemspd : uses Windows mouse settings, doesn't work with raw input
// -nosrgb : disables SRGB (limits variety of colors), brighter lighting, flatter colors, FPS boost
// -nops2b : uses pixel shaders 2.0 instead of 2.0b, results in thicker fog and FPS boost
// -nostartupsound : disable game music on main menu
// -nosound : disables sound, no performance boost unless your drivers are slow
// -mat_softwaretl : forces software vertex processing, might be good for potato GPUs, will decrease FPS otherwise
// -small : allow for resolutions smaller than 640x480

// --- Network ---
// Client prediction suffers greatly if you have
// network updates more than once per frame, so please

// prediction errors are often large and making entities jump instantly
