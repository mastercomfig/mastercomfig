# mastercomfig

Welcome to [mastercomfig](https://mastercomfig.com/), a modern Team Fortress 2 performance and customization config.

This config is by default for modern PCs and aims to disable heavily unoptimized
features and adjust other settings where it does not affect behavior or visuals
noticeably. However, the config is documented extensively and also has presets
so that you may adjust settings to your needs/preferences.

You may find that this config makes TF2 a lot smoother, eliminates stuttering,
reduces load times and increases FPS. This is because this config is heavily
tuned and the commands and values are based on TF2's source code, rather than
just experiments, guesswork and trying to understand the vague/non-existent
documentation.

The config is constantly updated with tweaks, new features and documentation
improvements â€” iterated upon based on user feedback and benchmarks. So if you
think there's an unoptimal value, or if it's just as simple as a comment being
confusing to you, report the problem and you'll most likely see a fix in a
future update.
