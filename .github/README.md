# mastercomfig

Welcome to [mastercomfig](https://mastercomfig.com/)-gmod, a modern GMOD performance and customization config, forked from https://github.com/mastercomfig/mastercomfig.

This config is by default for modern PCs and aims to disable heavily unoptimized
features and adjust other settings where it does not affect behavior or visuals
noticeably. However, the config is documented extensively and also has presets
so that you may adjust settings to your needs/preferences.

This is a fork of the TF2 comfig with variables updated for GMOD values.

The config is constantly updated with tweaks, new features and documentation
improvements — iterated upon based on user feedback and benchmarks. So if you
think there's an unoptimal value, or if it's just as simple as a comment being
confusing to you, report the problem and you'll most likely see a fix in a
future update.
