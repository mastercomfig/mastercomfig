# mastercomfig

Welcome to [mastercomfig](https://mastercomfig.com/), a modern customization framework.

mastercomfig aims to disable heavily unoptimized features and adjust other settings where it does not affect behavior or visuals noticeably. mastercomfig is documented extensively and has advanced customization features so that you may adjust settings to your needs/preferences.

You may find that mastercomfig makes TF2 much smoother, eliminates stuttering, reduces load times, and increases FPS. This is because mastercomfig is heavily tuned, and the commands and values are based on TF2’s source code rather than experiments, guesswork, and trying to understand the vague/non-existent documentation.

mastercomfig is constantly updated with tweaks, new features, and documentation improvements — iterated upon based on user feedback and benchmarks. So if you think there’s a nonoptimal value, or if it’s as simple as a comment confusing you, report the problem, and you’ll most likely see a fix in a future update.
