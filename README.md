# mastercomfig

This config is by default for modern PCs and aims to disable heavily unoptimized
features and adjust other settings where it does not affect behavior or visuals
noticeably. However, the config is documented extensively and also has presets
so that you may adjust settings to your needs/preferences.

You may find that this config makes TF2 a lot smoother, eliminates stuttering,
reduces load times and increases FPS. This is because this config is heavily tuned
and the commands and values are based on TF2's source code, rather than just
experiments, guesswork and trying to understand the vague/non-existent documentation.

The config is constantly updated with tweaks, new features and documentation improvements â€”
iterated upon based on user feedback and benchmarks. So if you think there's an unoptimal value,
or if it's just as simple as a comment being confusing to you, report the problem and you'll
probably see a fix in a future update.

## Installation

### Installation (VPK)

Download the VPK of your choice from the [latest release](https://github.com/mastercoms/tf2cfg/releases/latest), drag the VPK to your `tf/custom` folder after [cleaning your config](#clean-up), along with any addons if needed.

For more information about presets or addons to help you choose, see [here](https://github.com/mastercoms/tf2cfg/wiki/Presets-and-Addons).

To get to your `tf/custom` folder, right click Team Fortress 2 in your library, click properties,
go to the `local files` tab, and then click the `browse local files...` button. Then, open the `tf` folder
and then open the `custom` folder.

If you have your own `autoexec.cfg` already, rename it to `custom.cfg`.

Finally, go to Team Fortress 2 properties again and click the `set launch options...` button.
Copy and paste `-novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -noff -softparticlesdefaultoff -reuse` into the box and click ok.
More information on launch options can be found [here](https://github.com/mastercoms/tf2cfg/wiki/Launch-Options).

### Installation (ZIP)

Download `mastercomfig.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/mastercoms/tf2cfg/releases/latest) and then extract the `mastercomfig` and `mastercomfig_exec` folders to `TF2_FOLDER/tf/custom` after [cleaning your config](#clean-up).

To get to the `TF2_FOLDER`, right click Team Fortress 2 in your library, click properties,
go to the `local files` tab, and then click the `browse local files...` button.

If you already have your own `autoexec.cfg`, copy the contents of `mastercomfig_exec/cfg/autoexec.cfg`
to the top of your own `autoexec.cfg` and then delete the `mastercomfig_exec` folder. Do the same with `listenserver.cfg`.

Finally, go to Team Fortress 2 properties again and click the `set launch options...` button.
Copy and paste `-novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -noff -softparticlesdefaultoff -reuse` into the box and click ok.
More information on launch options can be found in `mastercomfig_exec/cfg/autoexec.cfg`.

You can also find some instructions at the bottom of `mastercomfig_exec/cfg/autoexec.cfg` to change the config for maximum performance, maximum quality, etc.

If you're using Linux or macOS, check out the wiki for [some optional instructions](https://github.com/mastercoms/tf2cfg/wiki/OpenGL-Systems).

## Updating

### Updating (VPK)

Drag the new VPK to your custom folder, replacing the old one.

### Updating (ZIP)

Download the update's release ZIP and then extract the `mastercomfig` folder to `TF2_FOLDER/tf/custom`.

You won't need to copy the other folders unless specified in the update. This means that if you miss a few updates,
make sure to look through the release notes for each update you missed to see if the other folders require an update.

## Clean up

**NOTE: This will reset ALL settings. Make sure you back up your binds and other
custom settings before you do this.**

If you have already have a config, or want to remove mastercomfig, delete any configs you
may have in `TF2_FOLDER/tf/custom` and delete the `TF2_FOLDER/tf/cfg` folder.
Then [verify your game files](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335) using Steam.

Next, if you have Steam Cloud Synchronization enabled, make all the files in `STEAM_FOLDER/userdata/USER_ID/440/remote/cfg` blank. Do not delete them, or else Steam Cloud will redownload them.

Finally, launch TF2 with only the `-novid -default -autoconfig +host_writeconfig +mat_savechanges +quit` launch options. The game will launch and exit. Afterwards, remove these launch options.
