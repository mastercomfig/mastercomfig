# Dev scripts

This folder contains scripts to build release files and manage releases.

## No Tutorial Viewed

`no_tutorial_viewed.sh` generates `viewed.res` for the No Tutorial addon, by
setting a viewed count that disables goal notifications ("You are now
Attacking!") and map intro movies. It does this by temporarily copying
`generate_viewed.sh` to `TF2_DIR/tf/maps` and executing it, and moving the
resultant `viewed.res` into the No Tutorial addon's `media` folder.

## Packaging

This creates the necessary files for releases (VPKs for addons and presets,
and the autoexecs for cfg.tf).

### Presets

This collects the common files from the config folder, then generates an
`autoexec.cfg` that executes `comfig/comfig.cfg`, the appropriate preset, all addons
(which will skip execution if not preset) and `user/autoexec.cfg`. Overrides are then
copied on top of the common files.

Each preset's folder is then packaged into a VPK.

This requires a `vpk` script installed to your binaries.
See [VDC](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VPK#Linux_.2F_Unix).

### Addons

This script collects the files from the various addons and generates a
VPK for each.

This requires a `vpk` script installed to your binaries.
See [VDC](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VPK#Linux_.2F_Unix).

## Releases

Release scripts are used for releasing final versions for the config and are
not generally useful for public use.

### Deployment

This will create a GitHub release and upload the files generated from packaging
to that release.

### Announcements

This will send an announcement to a Discord channel, and generate BBCode from
the supplied version and highlights text.

## mastercomfig-vars

This is a file that must be supplied by the user with the following entries:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
export DISCORD_WEBHOOK="Discord webhook for release notifications"
export TF2_DIR="absolute path to Team Fortress 2 directory"
```

You may also opt to set these variables in your system environment.

## Environment variables

The dev scripts use a variety of environment variables to control their behavior:

* `zip_package`: used to mark the non-VPK generation stage of the packaging step, for the `mastercomfig zip package` release asset
* `prerelease`: deploys to the release tagged `dev`
* `minor_release`: skip updating the release branch in the release script
* `patch`: makes the release script patch the current release. currently, this still requires the maintainer to republish the release on GitHub using the new tagged draft.
* `CI`: used to mark CI specific tasks to skip or do. for example, it skips zipping the pre-release as GitHub Actions zips artifacts
