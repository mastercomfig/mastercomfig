You edit things by overriding things in your user overrides \u201clayer\u201d. Your user layer consists of a user modules layer, autoexec layer, game overrides layer, and class config layer. Modules override mastercomfig/preset modules layer. Autoexec layer overrides mastercomfig/addons layer. Game overrides layer overrides mastercomfig game overrides (run on game join/every time you change class), and per-class networking settings, for all classes. Class config layer overrides mastercomfig game overrides (class configs run after game overrides) and per-class networking settings, for a single class.</p> <p>This layered approach means that the config\u2019s settings are more managed (that is most things are done for you, with you changing a few things based on your own preference, so that settings don\u2019t conflict for best possible stability and performance), and contained (you can easily drop in a new version of mastercomfig, and your layers will remain in your overrides folder, so you don\u2019t have to re-edit anything whenever you change a version). See the next few questions for more details.</p> <p>With this approach, you\u2019ll find yourself reading documentation more rather than digging through config files, checking to see how you can do something or change a setting when you encounter something you\u2019d like changed. However, the GitHub source is a good reference for some things. For example, you can see the many comments within the main comfig.cfg for information about settings within mastercomfig, as well as how to override individual things at a finer level than with modules. But be careful about compatibility conflicts between different console variables in this case! You can see what modules are used in your preset so you only override modules that you need.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#why-does-mastercomfig-use-a-vpk","title":"Why does mastercomfig use a VPK?","text":"<p>mastercomfig is not just a configuration file like older FPS configs which only use autoexec.cfg. It is a complete performance and customization scripting mod which requires many custom files to work.</p> <p>Here are some of the features that mastercomfig gains, by being a mod rather a configuration file:</p> <ul> <li> <p>dxsupport overrides, which unlocks <code>r_drawropes</code>, <code>fx_drawimpactdebris</code>, <code>fx_drawimpactdust</code>, <code>fx_drawimpactspark</code>, <code>tf_impactwatertimeenable</code>, <code>dsp_off</code>, <code>cl_particle_retire_cost</code> and <code>mat_slopescaledepthbias_decal</code></p> </li> <li> <p>These allow for performance improvements for ropes, particles, sound, and fixing a bug where 1 decal still appears even if decals are disabled</p> </li> <li> <p>Class spawn scripts, which allow for scripts to be run periodically during a match</p> </li> <li> <p>Modular design which allows for an extensive user overrides system (modules, addons, configs), rather than having to redo edits every time mastercomfig updates and not know what edits you made from the base config</p> </li> <li> <p><code>mm_override</code> script, which fixes crashes while loading for Competitive matchmaking</p> </li> <li> <p>Optimized preload configuration, which improves memory usage and load times</p> </li> <li> <p>No messy cloud sync or config saving propagation which happens in the <code>cfg</code> folder</p> </li> </ul> <p>Now, this only explains why mastercomfig is a mod, which can also be a folder, rather than explaining why mastercomfig is a VPK.</p> <p>mastercomfig is specifically a VPK because:</p> <ul> <li>Encourages people to use the modular customization system in mastercomfig, which does not require manual intervention every update to redo custom settings</li> <li>Easy distribution, and drag and drop into the custom folder, and recommended by Valve:</li> </ul> <p>Quote</p> <p>First, mount all user customizations. This will search for VPKs and subfolders and mount them in alphabetical order. The easiest way to distribute a mod is to pack up the custom content into a VPK. To \u201cinstall\u201d a mod, just drop it in this folder.</p> <p>Source</p> <ul> <li>Better performance, as stated by Valve:</li> </ul> <p>Quote</p> <p>When the game boots, this folder is automatically scanned for VPK files or subfolders. Each subfolder or VPK is added as a search path, so the files inside those VPK\u2019s or subfolders will override the default game files. Mounting a VPK to the filesystem is more efficient than adding a subfolder, as each time the engine needs to open a file, it will need to make a call to the operating system to search the folder. VPKs can therefore be searched by the engine much more efficiently. Each subfolder is a new search path that must be checked each time the engine tries to open a file. So, for optimal load times, always use VPK files and don\u2019t make any subfolders in this folder!</p> <p>Source</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>We search VPK files before ordinary folders, because most files will be found in VPK and we can avoid making thousands of file system calls to attempt to open files in folders where they don\u2019t exist.

If you add \u201c+cpu_frequency_monitoring 2\u201d to your launch options then the CPU\u2019s speed will be measured every two seconds.

Under normal circumstances this percentage should be 90% or higher. If the displayed CPU frequency percentage drops below about 80-85% then it suggests that your CPU may be overheating and being thermally throttled.

If these CPU slowdowns happen when your game is running slowly then it is reasonable to assume that they are the cause and that your CPU is overheating.

Interp is a low-level networking setting which controls how incoming packets are used by the client. Packets have an inherent delay, and may not come at all due to issues along your route, low server framerate, server framerate variance, and ping fluctuations. Interp is a very sensitive networking setting which tunes your buffer for incoming packets. If you set it too low, you will get networking errors, resulting in worse hitreg, because of trying to use game packets which have not come in yet.</p> <p>Imagine it like controlling the size of the gray bar in YouTube. If you set it too high, your video playback will be delayed. If you set it too low, then you will be constantly encountering freezing in video playback as the video download tries to keep up with playback. In the case of TF2, when the client needs to use a new server game packet when there is not one, it will instead extrapolate movement based on previous data, assuming that everything is continuing on its same path, which can be wildly inaccurate.</p> <p>If you are worried about the delay being high, rest assured that the tick delay caused by interpolation is compensated for the following: hitscan, melee, backstabs, flamethrower and the Medigun. Projectiles are simulated on the server, and thus are not compensated. Projectile spawns and despawns are not interpolated, which means that you may notice a client-side delay in projectiles exiting your barrel and subsequently impacting the target. In a game like TF2, this is not a huge issue, and you should be more worried about the accuracy of game state rather than a few milliseconds of client-side delay.</p> <p>Now having said all that, you still have the option to change interp if you really want to and understand what you\u2019re doing. The best way to change interp is to use the snapshot buffer module, which has a few preset values for the most common use case of higher than normal packet loss. If you want a specific interp value, the best place to set it is in <code>autoexec.cfg</code> (make sure it is in the <code>overrides</code> folder), like so:</p> <pre><code>cl_interp_ratio x\ncl_interp x\n</code></pre> <p>And then put this in <code>modules.cfg</code>:</p> <pre><code>snapshot_buffer=custom\n</code></pre> <p>One other thing to note is that client interp is determined by whichever is the greater of cl_interp_ratio divided by cl_updaterate, and the value of cl_interp. cl_interp_ratio and cl_interp have no interaction beyond that.</p>"},{"location":"next_steps/quick_fixes/#scottish-resistance-stickybombs-have-no-outline","title":"Scottish Resistance stickybombs have no outline","text":"<p>Warning</p> <p>Outlines of any kind do not work on DirectX 8.</p> <p>On some mastercomfig presets, outlines are disabled.

I was interested to see if I could make a Custom Intro, and it turns out it\u2019s really easy.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Download The RAD Video Tools program. This program allows you to convert video and audio files to <code>.bik</code> format, which is the format that the opening Valve video is in.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open up RAD Video Tools and find your video of choice. Select the video and press the Bink it! button. (See below)</p> </li> </ol> <p> </p> <p>You can mess with the above settings to get higher quality video, but leaving the settings as the default garners you a decent result.</p> <p>You may find that while the program attempts to render, it will give you an Error when trying to open the file. I originally tried this using videos I had downloaded online, and the program did not like it. I eventually made a small HUDS.TF intro video using Sony Vegas, and saved it as a <code>.avi</code> file. This seemed to have done the trick, and you may get the result you want by putting your videos into a Video Editor first.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Once converted (shouldn\u2019t take long), watch the file back and make sure it\u2019s okay. Audio can be a bit of a pain (may not render), so you can mix audio in after by selecting the generated <code>.bik</code> file, then pressing the Mix in sound button. Just add your sound file of choice and the default settings should do the rest. Again, feel free to mess around with the settings if you want to get better results.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once you\u2019ve got the file you\u2019ve wanted, go into your Custom HUD folder. Create a media folder in the same directory your resource and scripts folders are (example below)</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Inside this folder, copy your <code>.bik</code> file into it, and create a file called startupvids.txt. Inside this file, you\u2019ll only need one line of text, which is <code>media/&lt;FILENAME&gt;.bik</code>, where <code>&lt;FILENAME&gt;</code> is, obviously, the name of your file. (examples below)</p> <p></p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Now open up Team Fortress 2 (make sure you do not have <code>-novid</code> in your launch options), and you\u2019ll see the result!</li> </ol> <p>Watch my example here:</p> <p>I\u2019ve also included an example file for you to use!</p> <p>Note</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to put this into a Custom HUD folder. You can make a separate Custom folder for your intro video to live in individually, so it will run on every Custom HUD you use, or even on the default TF2 HUD, similar to the way you would do a hitsound. <code>tf/custom/introvideo/media/</code> and then your files would work.</p>"},{"location":"tf2/huds/font_crosshairs/","title":"Installing Font Crosshairs","text":"<p>Originally posted by HarvardBB on the huds.tf guide forums</p> <p>HUD Crosshairs are easy to install, but hard to make. For the simpleness of this thread, we will install pre-made crosshairs instead of making our own. Also a note, this installation is only for Windows, sorry Mac, and Linux users.</p> <p>For the sake of this tutorial we will be installing Seeker\u2019s Crosshair (Download, Linux Download) onto my HUD, HARVARDHUD.</p> <p>You Will Need</p> <ul> <li>A HUD</li> <li>Notepad++(Download)</li> <li>The crosshair font file of your choice</li> </ul> <p>Step 1.</p> <p>Locate your HUD files, you can do this easily by going to your Steam Library, right-clicking on Team Fortress 2, select Properties, select the \u201cLocal Files\u201d tab, select \u201cBrowse..\u201d, select the <code>tf</code> folder, select the <code>custom</code> folder, and inside should be your HUD folder.</p> <p>Step 2.</p> <p>First we need to install the font file into the HUD. First, locate the <code>clientscheme.res</code> file by going to <code>harvardhud/resource</code> and you will find it in there. Next, press CTRL+F and search for <code>ECON FONTS</code> and scroll down till you find a section called <code>HUD Fonts</code>, this name will differ from HUD to HUD, but my HUD has all of the HUD Fonts under <code>HUD Fonts</code>. You must then add this section of code into the client scheme here. This will give you the flexibility to have the crosshair with or without an underline, which ever you prefer.</p> <pre><code>\"seeker11\"\n{\n\"1\"\n{\n\"name\"                  \"TF2Crosshairs\"\n\"tall\"                  \"11\"\n\"weight\"                \"0\"\n\"antialias\"             \"1\"\n\"outline\"               \"1\"\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Should look like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Step 3.</p> <p>Now, while still inside the client scheme, scroll down to the very bottom.  You will find something that looks similar to this</p> <p></p> <p>You must add this exact code under the last font definition, and your font definition numbers should go in order, so for me, Seeker\u2019s Crosshair font will be <code>15</code>. The font name is also not a choice, it is what the author of the font signed it as, you can find out the exact name of any font by right-clicking the font, selecting Properties, selecting Details, and the <code>Title</code> of the font is the name.</p> <pre><code>\"15\"\n{\n\"font\" \"resource/crosshairs/TF2Crosshairs.ttf\"\n\"font\" \"resource/crosshairs/tf2crosshairs_linux.ttf\" [$LINUX]\n\"name\" \"TF2Crosshairs\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>See here:</p> <p></p> <p>The result should look something similar to this:</p> <p></p> <p>Remember to save your file!</p> <p>Step 4.</p> <p>Locate the <code>hudlayout.res</code> file by going to <code>harvardhud/scripts</code> and it will be in there. Most HUDs will have there crosshairs right in the front, as mine does as well. My HUD is a little bit more trickier than other HUDs as I have pre-animated, and pre-outlined HUD crosshairs to choose from. You can install the HUD Crosshair anywhere in the file, for the sake of the order of my crosshairs in my HUD, I\u2019m going to be doing it a certain way, you can put it at the very top if you would like.</p> <p>The file when you first open it should look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Now press CTRL+F and search for \u201cYZ50KonrWings\u201d as I will be installing the Seeker\u2019s Crosshair right underneath that, this is only for my HUD, and your HUD will most likely be different. Now insert this section of code into the file.</p> <p>It should look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>If you want to change the color of the crosshair, you have to edit the <code>fgcolor</code>, you can pick out the color by using this to help you select a color, note the first digit is the red value, second digit is green, third is blue, and the final digit is the alpha or transparency value, you should leave that at <code>255</code> unless you actually do want a transparent crosshair (which most do not). Now if the crosshair is not perfectly centered, you must mess with the <code>xpos</code>, <code>ypos</code>, and <code>wide</code>, and <code>tall</code> values. It can sometimes be a very painful process, though I am almost certain that the way the Seeker\u2019s Crosshair is now, it is perfectly centered, so do not mess with it unless you are positive it is not centered.</p> <p>Remember to save the file!</p> <p>Final Step.</p> <p>Now take the font file previously mentioned above and install it in the HUD. Most HUDs tend to have a dedicated <code>fonts</code> folder for their HUD, most HUDs including my own will have it be in <code>harvardhud/resource/fonts</code> and you just drop the file into there. Note, the file path of the installed font in the client scheme must match.</p> <p>See here:</p> <p></p> <p>See how the file path is the same. The end result of the font folder should look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Now enabling the font is by far the easiest part.</p> <p>All you do is go into the <code>hudlayout.res</code> file in <code>harvardhud/scripts</code>, and find the HUD crosshair you want to use, and make the <code>enabled</code> and <code>visible</code> value both <code>1</code>, although most HUDs including my own have all crosshairs enabled, but not visible, so you will most likely only have to change the value of <code>visible</code>.</p> <p>Enabling Seeker\u2019s Crosshair will look like this:</p> <p></p> <p>And of course, do not forget to save the file!</p> <p>Sorry for the long wall of text and the messy guide, but hopefully it will get the job done.</p>"},{"location":"tf2/huds/hud_animations/","title":"Using the HUD Animations Manifest","text":"<p>Originally posted by omnibombulator on huds.tf</p> <p>Having a <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file in your custom HUD has proved somewhat of a hassle in TF2 updates. It\u2019s the primary cause of most in-game crashes and bugs. Even an update that doesn\u2019t change much in the way of actual HUD elements could cause a problem if the <code>hudanimations_tf</code> file is outdated.</p> <p>But there\u2019s a way to avoid this headache, so allow me to guide you through it.</p> <p><code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code>, the magic file When you extract the HUD from TF2 using GCFScape or this handy GitHub, you\u2019ll find the file <code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code> inside the <code>scripts</code> folder. This is the primary file we\u2019ll be using to get around avoiding HUD animation related crashes and having to update your <code>hudanimations_tf</code> file constantly to new updates.</p> <p>The file is extremely simple, including no more than 6 lines of code:</p> <pre><code>hudanimations_manifest\n{\n\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations.txt\"\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations_tf.txt\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p><code>hudanimations_manifest</code> is the file that tells the game what files to read animations from. So, it reads from the default Source <code>hudanimations.txt</code> file and the TF2 <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file. But we can add more files to this list. Our own files.</p> <p>First up, go to your scripts folder, open the <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file and copy any animations that have been modified in your HUD. Commonly modified animations are Health Animations (<code>HudHealthBonusPulse</code>, <code>HudHealthBonusPulseLoop</code>, <code>HudHealthBonusPulseStop</code>, <code>HudHealthDyingPulse</code>, <code>HudHealthDyingPulseLoop</code>, <code>HudHealthDyingPulseStop</code>), Ammo Animations (<code>HudLowAmmoPulse</code>, <code>HudLowAmmoPulseLoop</code>, <code>HudLowAmmoPulseStop</code>) and Medic Animations (<code>HudMedicCharged</code>, <code>HudMedicChargedLoop</code>, <code>HudMedicChargedStop</code>). Paste the modified code into a new text file. For the sake of example, save the file as hudanimations_custom.txt to the scripts folder. Now you have a custom animation file, brilliant!</p> <p>Next step is to delete (or rename if you\u2019re unsure of if you\u2019ve missed some modified code) the custom <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file. We won\u2019t need this anymore, the game can read the original file from the <code>.vpk</code> the game includes from now on. This means the game will keep the animations up to date every time the game has an update that changes them!</p> <p>Now it\u2019s time to go back to the <code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code> file. We need to add the <code>hudanimations_custom.txt</code> file we created to it, so the game can read the animations from it.</p> <p>Quite simply, just add an extra line above the <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file value (as exampled below), then save the file:</p> <pre><code>hudanimations_manifest\n{\n\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations.txt\"\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations_custom.txt\"\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations_tf.txt\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>You can add as many different animation files as you like, so you can keep your Health, Ammo and Medic animations in separate files if you like it tidy that way! However, you must make sure that when you add extra files to <code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code>, that you place them above <code>hudanimations_tf</code>, else they will not overwrite the default TF2 animation file.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve followed everything correctly, your custom animations should work, and the game will keep all future animations updated for you. Of course, if your custom animations get updated, you will have to manually update them, however, common animation modifications such as Health and Ammo are rarely updated.</p>"},{"location":"tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/","title":"In-Depth HUD Crosshair Guide","text":"<p>Originally posted by omnibombulator on huds.tf</p> <p>This guide has been ported over from the old HUDS.TF Guides section.

It displays information relevant to the user while in-game, such as health, ammo, the scoreboard, and much more. It is controlled by text documents that determine positioning, size, visibility, color, and everything else about all of its moving bits and pieces. These documents, saved as <code>.res</code> files, can be edited by the user to change existing bits and pieces, which will henceforth referred to as controls, or, more interestingly, at least for our purposes, add new controls. One technique users have been using since as early as 2009 is to place a control into their HUDs to serve as a crosshair. That is, something that will tell them where the center of their screen is.

Here\u2019s how.</p> <p></p> <p>Thanks to Lange for letting me point you to his explanation. Antialiasing is pretty different in fonts, and doesn\u2019t always work, so try enabling/disabling it yourself and see.</p> <p>In addition to antialiasing, you might want to change <code>\"outline\"</code> to <code>1</code>, which will put a black outline around your crosshair. It might be a bit buggy or pixelated, however, so, same as your crosshair, test out enabling and disabling it for optimum results.</p> <p>Back to resizing. Something a lot of HUD makers do to make things easier is to create many definitions for the same font. This is because the only way to change the size of a font is to change the font definition. So, an easy shortcut is to name each definition according to the size it is. For example, make one called <code>crosshair12</code>, with the <code>tall</code> value being <code>12</code>, another named <code>crosshair14</code> with the <code>tall</code> value of <code>14</code>, all the way up to <code>54</code>, which is the highest tall value that TF2 accepts. This is useful because TF2 doesn\u2019t reload <code>ClientScheme.res</code> (or the main menu, for that matter, if you\u2019re interested) when you type <code>hud_reloadscheme</code> in console, so you need to restart the game each time you change <code>ClientScheme.res</code>.

I elaborate on how exactly to change <code>fgcolor</code> below under Specific Parameters. For image crosshairs, it is significantly more difficult: you need to actually edit the <code>.vtf</code> file itself and change the color in an image editor.

The third possibility is only relevant if it\u2019s a text crosshair and you\u2019re using macOS or Linux; sometimes fonts get cut off in TF2 on macOS/Linux: this is due to differences in how Windows handles fonts compared to these operating systems, and therefore how TF2 expects its fonts to be handled.

Adding an <code>r</code> in front means that the control is positioned relative to the right side of the screen.

Now, for the up or down: <code>North</code> for up, <code>South</code> for down. Another, simpler way to explain is that this property uses the cardinal directions for values, as well as <code>Left</code> and <code>Right</code>. To enter more than one alignment you must use the cardinal directions with the vertical alignment first, for example <code>North-West</code> for top left alignment. Basically, think of the text as being inside of a box. The box is what the control creates, more accurately what the control actually is, and you define the wide and tall values for it. <code>Center</code> would make the text aligned to the center of the box. <code>West</code> would put it on the left side of the box. <code>East</code> would put it on the right side of the box.

You are going to want your dimensions to be a square power of 2.          I usually use 1024 by 1024 or 512 by 512, a square file is easier to center regardless of crosshair shape so I\u2019d advise making it square.</p> </li> <li> <p>Before you hit \u201cOK\u201d go to the arrow near \u201cAdvanced Options\u201d, click it, then go to \u201cFill With\u201d and select \u201cTransparency\u201d from the drop-down menu.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now you have your canvas on which to create your crosshair.</p> </li> <li> <p>The very basics are this: create a selection and fill it with a color. To this end, some useful tools are the selection tools, rectangle, ellipse, free select, etc.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Here are some tips and tricks to using these tools:</p> <ul> <li> <p>First off, whenever you are using a tool it\u2019s a good idea to have the \u201cTool Options\u201d window open. If you don\u2019t see it go up to Windows &gt; Dockable Dialogs &gt; Tool Options. This is extremely useful.</p> </li> <li> <p>For making a circle be uniform/perfect you can simply set aspect ratio to be 1:1 or change the dimensions manually in the same (Tool Options) window. Obviously the same can be used to mess with a rectangular selection/make it square.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you are copying and pasting/editing a pre-existing crosshair an extremely useful tool is the \u201cSelect By Color\u201d tool. It selects all pixels in the image of the color that you click on.</p> </li> <li> <p>For any of these selection tools it\u2019s useful to be able to subtract or add to it easily, so take note of the buttons at the top of the \u201cTool Options\u201d window: they change the mode of selection you are currently in, from making a new selection to adding/subtracting/intersecting with the current one. For example, to make a ring you make a circle then change the mode to subtract from selection and put a smaller circle inside. There are an abundance of GIMP tutorials on the subject, and a video does it much better than I can. Another example is that maybe selecting by color didn\u2019t get everything you hoped it would. Change to \u201cAdd to Selection\u201d and you can easily add different shades of the same color which you want to include that weren\u2019t picked up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Another useful trick for selecting by color is that if there is an image and you want to effectively get rid of a inform background you can select the background then hit Edit&gt;Clear to send it to transparent or Select &gt; Invert to invert the selection, effectively selecting every pixel in the image that is NOT the color you selected. The invert selection button is immensely useful in multiple other ways as well.</p> </li> <li> <p>One more useful tool is \u201cAlign\u201d to align your selection or layer to the center of the image for the easiest time making a multiple layered image look neat. For example, to make the backgrounds to the health cross I used in my HUD.   I made a circle selection, went to tool options, changed the size to 300 x 300, went to align tool, center aligned it, then filled the whole thing with blue or black or whichever. Then I made a rectangular selection, made it 75 x 200 ( I think, don\u2019t quite remember), centered it with the align tool. Then I went to edit&gt;clear to send that rectangle in the middle to transparent. Then I made another rectangular selection, 200 x 75 this time, and center aligned it, then \u201ccleared\u201d that one as well. The result satisfies my perfectionistic (is this a word?) OCD tendencies.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/#export","title":"Export","text":"<p>From here you can either use the VTF Photoshop/Paint.NET plugin or the GIMP VTF plugin to export to a <code>.vtf</code> file.

If you wish to do it by hand, simply make a new text document and paste this in:</p> <pre><code>\"UnlitGeneric\"\n{\n\"$translucent\" 1\n\"$basetexture\" \"vgui\\replay\\thumbnails\\&lt;your file name&gt;\"\n\"$yertexcolor\" 1\n\"$no_fullbright\" 1\n\"$ignorez\" 1\n}\n</code></pre> <p>For more advanced users: there are many interesting things that can be done with VMTs, such as making everything beneath it transparent, or making it spin or change color when you are moving. More info on that can be found here. To note: I couldn\u2019t personally get the proxy <code>PlayerDamageTime</code> to work at all, which is disappointing because if it had worked one could create a material in their HUD that would change color or become visible only when the player had crit-heals. I personally was going to make an outline for the health cross, or a bar under the health, although something near the crosshair would be cool too. JarateKing, who knows much more about material proxies than I do, likewise failed, so that particular proxy might not work in TF2, unfortunately.</p> <p>Here is an example <code>.vmt</code> where the crosshair would rotate, pulse blue, and flash green when you are moving:</p> <pre><code>\"UnlitGeneric\"\n{\n\"$translucent\" \"1\"\n\"$basetexture\" \"vgui\\replay\\thumbnails\\crosshair_kent_010\"\n\n\"$angle\" \"0.0\"\n\"$translate\" \"[0.0 0.0]\"\n\"$center\" \"[0.5 0.5]\"\n\n\"$color\" \"[0.0 0.0 0.0]\"\n\"$speed\" \"0\"\n\n\"$vertexcolor\" \"1\"\n\"$no_fullbright\" \"1\"\n\"$vertexalpha\" \"1\"\n\"$ignorez\" \"1\"\n\n\"Proxies\"\n{\n// Rotates the crosshair\n\"LinearRamp\"\n{\n\"rate\" \"600\" // Adjust this, higher spins faster\n\"initialValue\" \"0.0\"\n\"resultVar\" \"$angle\"\n}\n\"TextureTransform\"\n{\n\"translateVar\" \"$translate\"\n\"rotateVar\" \"$angle\"\n\"centerVar\" \"$center\"\n\"resultVar\" \"$basetexturetransform\"\n}\n\n// Makes the crosshair pulse blue\n\"Sine\"\n{\n\"sinemin\" \"0.3\"\n\"minemax\" \"0.5\"\n\"sineperiod\" \"1\"\n\"resultVar\" \"$color[2]\"\n}\n\n// Makes the crosshair light up green when the player is moving\n\"PlayerSpeed\"\n{\n\"resultVar\" \"$speed\"\n}\n\"Clamp\"\n{\n\"min\" \"0.5\"\n\"max\" \"1.0\"\n\"srcVar1\" \"$speed\"\n\"resultVar\" \"$color[1]\"\n}\n\n// Enable animation in the crosshair, set framerate\n//\"AnimatedTexture\"\n//{\n// \"animatedtexturevar\" \"$basetexture\"\n// \"animatedtextureframenumvar\" \"$frame\"\n// \"animatedtextureframerate\" \"30\"\n//}\n}\n\n}\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>More info on this specific crosshair found in this YouTube video.</p> <p>Another example:</p> <p></p> <p>More info on this specific <code>.vmt</code> including a download link can be found here.</p> <p>Here is an example <code>.vmt</code> where it would mask everything beneath it and make it transparent, which can be used to make anything in your HUD partially transparent, even your viewmodels.</p> <pre><code>\"Refract\"\n{\n\"%keywords\" \"tf\"\n\"$refractamount\" \"0.0\"\n\"$refracttint\" \"{255 255 255}\"\n\"$refractblur\" \"0.0\"\n\n\"$scale\" \"[1 1]\"\n\"$normalmap\" \"vgui/replay/thumbnails/REFRACTnormal\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Here is more information on transparent viewmodels with this method.</p> <p>The path to create your own text crosshair is one I confess I personally have never done. I do, however, understand the basic concept. What you will need to do is to create a vector image of the crosshair that you want to use, the application to use for that is probably Adobe Illustrator, a free application I have used is Inkscape, which is compatible with GIMP. I wouldn\u2019t highly recommend Inkscape but you can easily Google alternatives yourself. Then get your hands on a font editor, FontForge probably being the best, although there are many other alternatives. Import your vector image into your custom font and save it as a <code>.ttf</code> or <code>.otf</code> and vo\u00edla. Google will need to be your friend on this one as I cannot help you much, sorry.</p>"},{"location":"tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/#toggling","title":"Toggling","text":"<p>Toggling your HUD crosshair means turning it on or off at will.

On the other hand, <code>TextExample</code>, the text crosshair, would only be visible when minmode is off, or, when <code>cl_hud_minmode</code> is set to <code>0</code>. In this way you can use a console command to turn your crosshair on or off as you please. However, this is the method that I referenced earlier as being by class, meaning I recommend putting the command in your class configs to turn the crosshair on or off based on which class you are. The reason is that toggling this command causes in-game stutter, which makes sense: after all, the command is essentially telling the game to reload every single HUD file, similar to a <code>hud_reloadscheme</code>.</p>"},{"location":"tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/#achievement-tracker","title":"Achievement Tracker","text":"<p>This method is a bit more complicated, but the concept remains simple.

Basically: Valve added a feature to use, instead of the default class image, a dynamic and 3D player model complete with accurate weapons, hats, and running/swimming postures. Due to performance issues, Valve added a console command to toggle the feature on or off. By replacing the background that accompanies, by default, this feature, with our own image crosshair, we can then toggle the crosshair on or off at will. I would recommend only using this method if you can live without the 3D model. If you do wish to use it, all that is necessary to do this is to replace the following control in <code>HudPlayerClass.res</code> with your crosshair.</p> <p></p> <p>So, using my previous example image crosshair, it would look something like this:</p> <pre><code>\"classmodelpanelBG\"\n{\n\"ControlName\" \"CTFImagePanel\"\n\"fieldName\" \"classmodelpanelBG\"\n\"visible\" \"0\"\n\"enabled\" \"1\"\n\"visible_minmode\" \"0\"\n\"enabled_minmode\" \"1\"\n\"xpos\" \"c0\"\n\"ypos\" \"c0\"\n\"zpos\" \"0\"\n\"wide\" \"100\"\n\"tall\" \"100\"\n\"alpha\" \"255\"\n\"image\" \"replay/thumbnails/*your file name*\"\n\"scaleimage\" \"1\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The only thing to be careful about is that you have <code>visible</code> set to <code>0</code> and <code>enabled</code> set to <code>1</code>. As explained under their respective sections under Basic Parameters, this ensures that you can actually turn it off or on. If <code>enabled</code> and <code>visible</code> are both set to <code>0</code> your crosshair will never show up because it will never be loaded by the HUD. If both are set to <code>1</code> then the crosshair will always be visible and you won\u2019t be able to truly \u201ctoggle\u201d it on and off.</p> <p>Another thing you may want to do is scroll down a little bit in <code>HudPlayerClass.res</code> and change <code>xpos</code> to <code>9999</code> under <code>\"classmodelpanel\"</code>.

You edit things by overriding things in your user overrides \u201clayer\u201d. Your user layer consists of a user modules layer, autoexec layer, game overrides layer, and class config layer. Modules override mastercomfig/preset modules layer. Autoexec layer overrides mastercomfig/addons layer. Game overrides layer overrides mastercomfig game overrides (run on game join/every time you change class), and per-class networking settings, for all classes. Class config layer overrides mastercomfig game overrides (class configs run after game overrides) and per-class networking settings, for a single class.</p> <p>This layered approach means that the config\u2019s settings are more managed (that is most things are done for you, with you changing a few things based on your own preference, so that settings don\u2019t conflict for best possible stability and performance), and contained (you can easily drop in a new version of mastercomfig, and your layers will remain in your overrides folder, so you don\u2019t have to re-edit anything whenever you change a version). See the next few questions for more details.</p> <p>With this approach, you\u2019ll find yourself reading documentation more rather than digging through config files, checking to see how you can do something or change a setting when you encounter something you\u2019d like changed. However, the GitHub source is a good reference for some things. For example, you can see the many comments within the main comfig.cfg for information about settings within mastercomfig, as well as how to override individual things at a finer level than with modules. But be careful about compatibility conflicts between different console variables in this case! You can see what modules are used in your preset so you only override modules that you need.</p>"},{"location":"en/faq/#why-does-mastercomfig-use-a-vpk","title":"Why does mastercomfig use a VPK?","text":"<p>mastercomfig is not just a configuration file like older FPS configs which only use autoexec.cfg. It is a complete performance and customization scripting mod which requires many custom files to work.</p> <p>Here are some of the features that mastercomfig gains, by being a mod rather a configuration file:</p> <ul> <li> <p>dxsupport overrides, which unlocks <code>r_drawropes</code>, <code>fx_drawimpactdebris</code>, <code>fx_drawimpactdust</code>, <code>fx_drawimpactspark</code>, <code>tf_impactwatertimeenable</code>, <code>dsp_off</code>, <code>cl_particle_retire_cost</code> and <code>mat_slopescaledepthbias_decal</code></p> </li> <li> <p>These allow for performance improvements for ropes, particles, sound, and fixing a bug where 1 decal still appears even if decals are disabled</p> </li> <li> <p>Class spawn scripts, which allow for scripts to be run periodically during a match</p> </li> <li> <p>Modular design which allows for an extensive user overrides system (modules, addons, configs), rather than having to redo edits every time mastercomfig updates and not know what edits you made from the base config</p> </li> <li> <p><code>mm_override</code> script, which fixes crashes while loading for Competitive matchmaking</p> </li> <li> <p>Optimized preload configuration, which improves memory usage and load times</p> </li> <li> <p>No messy cloud sync or config saving propagation which happens in the <code>cfg</code> folder</p> </li> </ul> <p>Now, this only explains why mastercomfig is a mod, which can also be a folder, rather than explaining why mastercomfig is a VPK.</p> <p>mastercomfig is specifically a VPK because:</p> <ul> <li>Encourages people to use the modular customization system in mastercomfig, which does not require manual intervention every update to redo custom settings</li> <li>Easy distribution, and drag and drop into the custom folder, and recommended by Valve:</li> </ul> <p>Quote</p> <p>First, mount all user customizations. This will search for VPKs and subfolders and mount them in alphabetical order. The easiest way to distribute a mod is to pack up the custom content into a VPK. To \u201cinstall\u201d a mod, just drop it in this folder.</p> <p>Source</p> <ul> <li>Better performance, as stated by Valve:</li> </ul> <p>Quote</p> <p>When the game boots, this folder is automatically scanned for VPK files or subfolders. Each subfolder or VPK is added as a search path, so the files inside those VPK\u2019s or subfolders will override the default game files. Mounting a VPK to the filesystem is more efficient than adding a subfolder, as each time the engine needs to open a file, it will need to make a call to the operating system to search the folder. VPKs can therefore be searched by the engine much more efficiently. Each subfolder is a new search path that must be checked each time the engine tries to open a file. So, for optimal load times, always use VPK files and don\u2019t make any subfolders in this folder!</p> <p>Source</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>We search VPK files before ordinary folders, because most files will be found in VPK and we can avoid making thousands of file system calls to attempt to open files in folders where they don\u2019t exist.

If the displayed CPU frequency percentage drops below about 80-85% then it suggests that your CPU may be overheating and being thermally throttled.

Interp is a low-level networking setting which controls how incoming packets are used by the client. Packets have an inherent delay, and may not come at all due to issues along your route, low server framerate, server framerate variance, and ping fluctuations. Interp is a very sensitive networking setting which tunes your buffer for incoming packets. If you set it too low, you will get networking errors, resulting in worse hitreg, because of trying to use game packets which have not come in yet.</p> <p>Imagine it like controlling the size of the gray bar in YouTube. If you set it too high, your video playback will be delayed. If you set it too low, then you will be constantly encountering freezing in video playback as the video download tries to keep up with playback. In the case of TF2, when the client needs to use a new server game packet when there is not one, it will instead extrapolate movement based on previous data, assuming that everything is continuing on its same path, which can be wildly inaccurate.</p> <p>If you are worried about the delay being high, rest assured that the tick delay caused by interpolation is compensated for the following: hitscan, melee, backstabs, flamethrower and the Medigun. Projectiles are simulated on the server, and thus are not compensated. Projectile spawns and despawns are not interpolated, which means that you may notice a client-side delay in projectiles exiting your barrel and subsequently impacting the target. In a game like TF2, this is not a huge issue, and you should be more worried about the accuracy of game state rather than a few milliseconds of client-side delay.</p> <p>Now having said all that, you still have the option to change interp if you really want to and understand what you\u2019re doing. The best way to change interp is to use the snapshot buffer module, which has a few preset values for the most common use case of higher than normal packet loss. If you want a specific interp value, the best place to set it is in <code>autoexec.cfg</code> (make sure it is in the <code>overrides</code> folder), like so:</p> <pre><code>cl_interp_ratio x\ncl_interp x\n</code></pre> <p>And then put this in <code>modules.cfg</code>:</p> <pre><code>snapshot_buffer=custom\n</code></pre> <p>One other thing to note is that client interp is determined by whichever is the greater of cl_interp_ratio divided by cl_updaterate, and the value of cl_interp. cl_interp_ratio and cl_interp have no interaction beyond that.</p>"},{"location":"en/next_steps/quick_fixes/#scottish-resistance-stickybombs-have-no-outline","title":"Scottish Resistance stickybombs have no outline","text":"<p>Warning</p> <p>Outlines of any kind do not work on DirectX 8.</p> <p>On some mastercomfig presets, outlines are disabled.

I was interested to see if I could make a Custom Intro, and it turns out it\u2019s really easy.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Download The RAD Video Tools program. This program allows you to convert video and audio files to <code>.bik</code> format, which is the format that the opening Valve video is in.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open up RAD Video Tools and find your video of choice. Select the video and press the Bink it! button. (See below)</p> </li> </ol> <p> </p> <p>You can mess with the above settings to get higher quality video, but leaving the settings as the default garners you a decent result.</p> <p>You may find that while the program attempts to render, it will give you an Error when trying to open the file. I originally tried this using videos I had downloaded online, and the program did not like it. I eventually made a small HUDS.TF intro video using Sony Vegas, and saved it as a <code>.avi</code> file. This seemed to have done the trick, and you may get the result you want by putting your videos into a Video Editor first.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Once converted (shouldn\u2019t take long), watch the file back and make sure it\u2019s okay. Audio can be a bit of a pain (may not render), so you can mix audio in after by selecting the generated <code>.bik</code> file, then pressing the Mix in sound button. Just add your sound file of choice and the default settings should do the rest. Again, feel free to mess around with the settings if you want to get better results.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once you\u2019ve got the file you\u2019ve wanted, go into your Custom HUD folder. Create a media folder in the same directory your resource and scripts folders are (example below)</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Inside this folder, copy your <code>.bik</code> file into it, and create a file called startupvids.txt. Inside this file, you\u2019ll only need one line of text, which is <code>media/&lt;FILENAME&gt;.bik</code>, where <code>&lt;FILENAME&gt;</code> is, obviously, the name of your file. (examples below)</p> <p></p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Now open up Team Fortress 2 (make sure you do not have <code>-novid</code> in your launch options), and you\u2019ll see the result!</li> </ol> <p>Watch my example here:</p> <p>I\u2019ve also included an example file for you to use!</p> <p>Note</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to put this into a Custom HUD folder. You can make a separate Custom folder for your intro video to live in individually, so it will run on every Custom HUD you use, or even on the default TF2 HUD, similar to the way you would do a hitsound. <code>tf/custom/introvideo/media/</code> and then your files would work.</p>"},{"location":"en/tf2/huds/font_crosshairs/","title":"Installing Font Crosshairs","text":"<p>Originally posted by HarvardBB on the huds.tf guide forums</p> <p>HUD Crosshairs are easy to install, but hard to make. For the simpleness of this thread, we will install pre-made crosshairs instead of making our own. Also a note, this installation is only for Windows, sorry Mac, and Linux users.</p> <p>For the sake of this tutorial we will be installing Seeker\u2019s Crosshair (Download, Linux Download) onto my HUD, HARVARDHUD.</p> <p>You Will Need</p> <ul> <li>A HUD</li> <li>Notepad++(Download)</li> <li>The crosshair font file of your choice</li> </ul> <p>Step 1.</p> <p>Locate your HUD files, you can do this easily by going to your Steam Library, right-clicking on Team Fortress 2, select Properties, select the \u201cLocal Files\u201d tab, select \u201cBrowse..\u201d, select the <code>tf</code> folder, select the <code>custom</code> folder, and inside should be your HUD folder.</p> <p>Step 2.</p> <p>First we need to install the font file into the HUD. First, locate the <code>clientscheme.res</code> file by going to <code>harvardhud/resource</code> and you will find it in there. Next, press CTRL+F and search for <code>ECON FONTS</code> and scroll down till you find a section called <code>HUD Fonts</code>, this name will differ from HUD to HUD, but my HUD has all of the HUD Fonts under <code>HUD Fonts</code>. You must then add this section of code into the client scheme here. This will give you the flexibility to have the crosshair with or without an underline, which ever you prefer.</p> <pre><code>\"seeker11\"\n{\n\"1\"\n{\n\"name\"                  \"TF2Crosshairs\"\n\"tall\"                  \"11\"\n\"weight\"                \"0\"\n\"antialias\"             \"1\"\n\"outline\"               \"1\"\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Should look like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Step 3.</p> <p>Now, while still inside the client scheme, scroll down to the very bottom.  You will find something that looks similar to this</p> <p></p> <p>You must add this exact code under the last font definition, and your font definition numbers should go in order, so for me, Seeker\u2019s Crosshair font will be <code>15</code>. The font name is also not a choice, it is what the author of the font signed it as, you can find out the exact name of any font by right-clicking the font, selecting Properties, selecting Details, and the <code>Title</code> of the font is the name.</p> <pre><code>\"15\"\n{\n\"font\" \"resource/crosshairs/TF2Crosshairs.ttf\"\n\"font\" \"resource/crosshairs/tf2crosshairs_linux.ttf\" [$LINUX]\n\"name\" \"TF2Crosshairs\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>See here:</p> <p></p> <p>The result should look something similar to this:</p> <p></p> <p>Remember to save your file!</p> <p>Step 4.</p> <p>Locate the <code>hudlayout.res</code> file by going to <code>harvardhud/scripts</code> and it will be in there. Most HUDs will have there crosshairs right in the front, as mine does as well. My HUD is a little bit more trickier than other HUDs as I have pre-animated, and pre-outlined HUD crosshairs to choose from. You can install the HUD Crosshair anywhere in the file, for the sake of the order of my crosshairs in my HUD, I\u2019m going to be doing it a certain way, you can put it at the very top if you would like.</p> <p>The file when you first open it should look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Now press CTRL+F and search for \u201cYZ50KonrWings\u201d as I will be installing the Seeker\u2019s Crosshair right underneath that, this is only for my HUD, and your HUD will most likely be different. Now insert this section of code into the file.</p> <p>It should look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>If you want to change the color of the crosshair, you have to edit the <code>fgcolor</code>, you can pick out the color by using this to help you select a color, note the first digit is the red value, second digit is green, third is blue, and the final digit is the alpha or transparency value, you should leave that at <code>255</code> unless you actually do want a transparent crosshair (which most do not). Now if the crosshair is not perfectly centered, you must mess with the <code>xpos</code>, <code>ypos</code>, and <code>wide</code>, and <code>tall</code> values. It can sometimes be a very painful process, though I am almost certain that the way the Seeker\u2019s Crosshair is now, it is perfectly centered, so do not mess with it unless you are positive it is not centered.</p> <p>Remember to save the file!</p> <p>Final Step.</p> <p>Now take the font file previously mentioned above and install it in the HUD. Most HUDs tend to have a dedicated <code>fonts</code> folder for their HUD, most HUDs including my own will have it be in <code>harvardhud/resource/fonts</code> and you just drop the file into there. Note, the file path of the installed font in the client scheme must match.</p> <p>See here:</p> <p></p> <p>See how the file path is the same. The end result of the font folder should look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Now enabling the font is by far the easiest part.</p> <p>All you do is go into the <code>hudlayout.res</code> file in <code>harvardhud/scripts</code>, and find the HUD crosshair you want to use, and make the <code>enabled</code> and <code>visible</code> value both <code>1</code>, although most HUDs including my own have all crosshairs enabled, but not visible, so you will most likely only have to change the value of <code>visible</code>.</p> <p>Enabling Seeker\u2019s Crosshair will look like this:</p> <p></p> <p>And of course, do not forget to save the file!</p> <p>Sorry for the long wall of text and the messy guide, but hopefully it will get the job done.</p>"},{"location":"en/tf2/huds/hud_animations/","title":"Using the HUD Animations Manifest","text":"<p>Originally posted by omnibombulator on huds.tf</p> <p>Having a <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file in your custom HUD has proved somewhat of a hassle in TF2 updates. It\u2019s the primary cause of most in-game crashes and bugs. Even an update that doesn\u2019t change much in the way of actual HUD elements could cause a problem if the <code>hudanimations_tf</code> file is outdated.</p> <p>But there\u2019s a way to avoid this headache, so allow me to guide you through it.</p> <p><code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code>, the magic file When you extract the HUD from TF2 using GCFScape or this handy GitHub, you\u2019ll find the file <code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code> inside the <code>scripts</code> folder. This is the primary file we\u2019ll be using to get around avoiding HUD animation related crashes and having to update your <code>hudanimations_tf</code> file constantly to new updates.</p> <p>The file is extremely simple, including no more than 6 lines of code:</p> <pre><code>hudanimations_manifest\n{\n\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations.txt\"\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations_tf.txt\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p><code>hudanimations_manifest</code> is the file that tells the game what files to read animations from. So, it reads from the default Source <code>hudanimations.txt</code> file and the TF2 <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file. But we can add more files to this list. Our own files.</p> <p>First up, go to your scripts folder, open the <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file and copy any animations that have been modified in your HUD. Commonly modified animations are Health Animations (<code>HudHealthBonusPulse</code>, <code>HudHealthBonusPulseLoop</code>, <code>HudHealthBonusPulseStop</code>, <code>HudHealthDyingPulse</code>, <code>HudHealthDyingPulseLoop</code>, <code>HudHealthDyingPulseStop</code>), Ammo Animations (<code>HudLowAmmoPulse</code>, <code>HudLowAmmoPulseLoop</code>, <code>HudLowAmmoPulseStop</code>) and Medic Animations (<code>HudMedicCharged</code>, <code>HudMedicChargedLoop</code>, <code>HudMedicChargedStop</code>). Paste the modified code into a new text file. For the sake of example, save the file as hudanimations_custom.txt to the scripts folder. Now you have a custom animation file, brilliant!</p> <p>Next step is to delete (or rename if you\u2019re unsure of if you\u2019ve missed some modified code) the custom <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file. We won\u2019t need this anymore, the game can read the original file from the <code>.vpk</code> the game includes from now on. This means the game will keep the animations up to date every time the game has an update that changes them!</p> <p>Now it\u2019s time to go back to the <code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code> file. We need to add the <code>hudanimations_custom.txt</code> file we created to it, so the game can read the animations from it.</p> <p>Quite simply, just add an extra line above the <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file value (as exampled below), then save the file:</p> <pre><code>hudanimations_manifest\n{\n\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations.txt\"\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations_custom.txt\"\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations_tf.txt\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>You can add as many different animation files as you like, so you can keep your Health, Ammo and Medic animations in separate files if you like it tidy that way! However, you must make sure that when you add extra files to <code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code>, that you place them above <code>hudanimations_tf</code>, else they will not overwrite the default TF2 animation file.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve followed everything correctly, your custom animations should work, and the game will keep all future animations updated for you. Of course, if your custom animations get updated, you will have to manually update them, however, common animation modifications such as Health and Ammo are rarely updated.</p>"},{"location":"en/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/","title":"In-Depth HUD Crosshair Guide","text":"<p>Originally posted by omnibombulator on huds.tf</p> <p>This guide has been ported over from the old HUDS.TF Guides section.

It displays information relevant to the user while in-game, such as health, ammo, the scoreboard, and much more. It is controlled by text documents that determine positioning, size, visibility, color, and everything else about all of its moving bits and pieces. These documents, saved as <code>.res</code> files, can be edited by the user to change existing bits and pieces, which will henceforth referred to as controls, or, more interestingly, at least for our purposes, add new controls. One technique users have been using since as early as 2009 is to place a control into their HUDs to serve as a crosshair. That is, something that will tell them where the center of their screen is.

It might be a bit buggy or pixelated, however, so, same as your crosshair, test out enabling and disabling it for optimum results.</p> <p>Back to resizing. Something a lot of HUD makers do to make things easier is to create many definitions for the same font. This is because the only way to change the size of a font is to change the font definition. So, an easy shortcut is to name each definition according to the size it is. For example, make one called <code>crosshair12</code>, with the <code>tall</code> value being <code>12</code>, another named <code>crosshair14</code> with the <code>tall</code> value of <code>14</code>, all the way up to <code>54</code>, which is the highest tall value that TF2 accepts. This is useful because TF2 doesn\u2019t reload <code>ClientScheme.res</code> (or the main menu, for that matter, if you\u2019re interested) when you type <code>hud_reloadscheme</code> in console, so you need to restart the game each time you change <code>ClientScheme.res</code>.

I elaborate on how exactly to change <code>fgcolor</code> below under Specific Parameters. For image crosshairs, it is significantly more difficult: you need to actually edit the <code>.vtf</code> file itself and change the color in an image editor.

The third possibility is only relevant if it\u2019s a text crosshair and you\u2019re using macOS or Linux; sometimes fonts get cut off in TF2 on macOS/Linux: this is due to differences in how Windows handles fonts compared to these operating systems, and therefore how TF2 expects its fonts to be handled.

Now, for the up or down: <code>North</code> for up, <code>South</code> for down. Another, simpler way to explain is that this property uses the cardinal directions for values, as well as <code>Left</code> and <code>Right</code>. To enter more than one alignment you must use the cardinal directions with the vertical alignment first, for example <code>North-West</code> for top left alignment. Basically, think of the text as being inside of a box. The box is what the control creates, more accurately what the control actually is, and you define the wide and tall values for it. <code>Center</code> would make the text aligned to the center of the box. <code>West</code> would put it on the left side of the box. <code>East</code> would put it on the right side of the box.

You are going to want your dimensions to be a square power of 2.          I usually use 1024 by 1024 or 512 by 512, a square file is easier to center regardless of crosshair shape so I\u2019d advise making it square.</p> </li> <li> <p>Before you hit \u201cOK\u201d go to the arrow near \u201cAdvanced Options\u201d, click it, then go to \u201cFill With\u201d and select \u201cTransparency\u201d from the drop-down menu.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now you have your canvas on which to create your crosshair.</p> </li> <li> <p>The very basics are this: create a selection and fill it with a color. To this end, some useful tools are the selection tools, rectangle, ellipse, free select, etc.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Here are some tips and tricks to using these tools:</p> <ul> <li> <p>First off, whenever you are using a tool it\u2019s a good idea to have the \u201cTool Options\u201d window open. If you don\u2019t see it go up to Windows &gt; Dockable Dialogs &gt; Tool Options. This is extremely useful.</p> </li> <li> <p>For making a circle be uniform/perfect you can simply set aspect ratio to be 1:1 or change the dimensions manually in the same (Tool Options) window. Obviously the same can be used to mess with a rectangular selection/make it square.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you are copying and pasting/editing a pre-existing crosshair an extremely useful tool is the \u201cSelect By Color\u201d tool. It selects all pixels in the image of the color that you click on.</p> </li> <li> <p>For any of these selection tools it\u2019s useful to be able to subtract or add to it easily, so take note of the buttons at the top of the \u201cTool Options\u201d window: they change the mode of selection you are currently in, from making a new selection to adding/subtracting/intersecting with the current one. For example, to make a ring you make a circle then change the mode to subtract from selection and put a smaller circle inside. There are an abundance of GIMP tutorials on the subject, and a video does it much better than I can. Another example is that maybe selecting by color didn\u2019t get everything you hoped it would. Change to \u201cAdd to Selection\u201d and you can easily add different shades of the same color which you want to include that weren\u2019t picked up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Another useful trick for selecting by color is that if there is an image and you want to effectively get rid of a inform background you can select the background then hit Edit&gt;Clear to send it to transparent or Select &gt; Invert to invert the selection, effectively selecting every pixel in the image that is NOT the color you selected. The invert selection button is immensely useful in multiple other ways as well.</p> </li> <li> <p>One more useful tool is \u201cAlign\u201d to align your selection or layer to the center of the image for the easiest time making a multiple layered image look neat. For example, to make the backgrounds to the health cross I used in my HUD.   I made a circle selection, went to tool options, changed the size to 300 x 300, went to align tool, center aligned it, then filled the whole thing with blue or black or whichever. Then I made a rectangular selection, made it 75 x 200 ( I think, don\u2019t quite remember), centered it with the align tool. Then I went to edit&gt;clear to send that rectangle in the middle to transparent. Then I made another rectangular selection, 200 x 75 this time, and center aligned it, then \u201ccleared\u201d that one as well. The result satisfies my perfectionistic (is this a word?) OCD tendencies.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"en/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/#export","title":"Export","text":"<p>From here you can either use the VTF Photoshop/Paint.NET plugin or the GIMP VTF plugin to export to a <code>.vtf</code> file.

If you wish to do it by hand, simply make a new text document and paste this in:</p> <pre><code>\"UnlitGeneric\"\n{\n\"$translucent\" 1\n\"$basetexture\" \"vgui\\replay\\thumbnails\\&lt;your file name&gt;\"\n\"$yertexcolor\" 1\n\"$no_fullbright\" 1\n\"$ignorez\" 1\n}\n</code></pre> <p>For more advanced users: there are many interesting things that can be done with VMTs, such as making everything beneath it transparent, or making it spin or change color when you are moving. More info on that can be found here. To note: I couldn\u2019t personally get the proxy <code>PlayerDamageTime</code> to work at all, which is disappointing because if it had worked one could create a material in their HUD that would change color or become visible only when the player had crit-heals. I personally was going to make an outline for the health cross, or a bar under the health, although something near the crosshair would be cool too. JarateKing, who knows much more about material proxies than I do, likewise failed, so that particular proxy might not work in TF2, unfortunately.</p> <p>Here is an example <code>.vmt</code> where the crosshair would rotate, pulse blue, and flash green when you are moving:</p> <pre><code>\"UnlitGeneric\"\n{\n\"$translucent\" \"1\"\n\"$basetexture\" \"vgui\\replay\\thumbnails\\crosshair_kent_010\"\n\n\"$angle\" \"0.0\"\n\"$translate\" \"[0.0 0.0]\"\n\"$center\" \"[0.5 0.5]\"\n\n\"$color\" \"[0.0 0.0 0.0]\"\n\"$speed\" \"0\"\n\n\"$vertexcolor\" \"1\"\n\"$no_fullbright\" \"1\"\n\"$vertexalpha\" \"1\"\n\"$ignorez\" \"1\"\n\n\"Proxies\"\n{\n// Rotates the crosshair\n\"LinearRamp\"\n{\n\"rate\" \"600\" // Adjust this, higher spins faster\n\"initialValue\" \"0.0\"\n\"resultVar\" \"$angle\"\n}\n\"TextureTransform\"\n{\n\"translateVar\" \"$translate\"\n\"rotateVar\" \"$angle\"\n\"centerVar\" \"$center\"\n\"resultVar\" \"$basetexturetransform\"\n}\n\n// Makes the crosshair pulse blue\n\"Sine\"\n{\n\"sinemin\" \"0.3\"\n\"minemax\" \"0.5\"\n\"sineperiod\" \"1\"\n\"resultVar\" \"$color[2]\"\n}\n\n// Makes the crosshair light up green when the player is moving\n\"PlayerSpeed\"\n{\n\"resultVar\" \"$speed\"\n}\n\"Clamp\"\n{\n\"min\" \"0.5\"\n\"max\" \"1.0\"\n\"srcVar1\" \"$speed\"\n\"resultVar\" \"$color[1]\"\n}\n\n// Enable animation in the crosshair, set framerate\n//\"AnimatedTexture\"\n//{\n// \"animatedtexturevar\" \"$basetexture\"\n// \"animatedtextureframenumvar\" \"$frame\"\n// \"animatedtextureframerate\" \"30\"\n//}\n}\n\n}\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>More info on this specific crosshair found in this YouTube video.</p> <p>Another example:</p> <p></p> <p>More info on this specific <code>.vmt</code> including a download link can be found here.</p> <p>Here is an example <code>.vmt</code> where it would mask everything beneath it and make it transparent, which can be used to make anything in your HUD partially transparent, even your viewmodels.</p> <pre><code>\"Refract\"\n{\n\"%keywords\" \"tf\"\n\"$refractamount\" \"0.0\"\n\"$refracttint\" \"{255 255 255}\"\n\"$refractblur\" \"0.0\"\n\n\"$scale\" \"[1 1]\"\n\"$normalmap\" \"vgui/replay/thumbnails/REFRACTnormal\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Here is more information on transparent viewmodels with this method.</p> <p>The path to create your own text crosshair is one I confess I personally have never done. I do, however, understand the basic concept. What you will need to do is to create a vector image of the crosshair that you want to use, the application to use for that is probably Adobe Illustrator, a free application I have used is Inkscape, which is compatible with GIMP. I wouldn\u2019t highly recommend Inkscape but you can easily Google alternatives yourself. Then get your hands on a font editor, FontForge probably being the best, although there are many other alternatives. Import your vector image into your custom font and save it as a <code>.ttf</code> or <code>.otf</code> and vo\u00edla. Google will need to be your friend on this one as I cannot help you much, sorry.</p>"},{"location":"en/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/#toggling","title":"Toggling","text":"<p>Toggling your HUD crosshair means turning it on or off at will.

On the other hand, <code>TextExample</code>, the text crosshair, would only be visible when minmode is off, or, when <code>cl_hud_minmode</code> is set to <code>0</code>. In this way you can use a console command to turn your crosshair on or off as you please. However, this is the method that I referenced earlier as being by class, meaning I recommend putting the command in your class configs to turn the crosshair on or off based on which class you are. The reason is that toggling this command causes in-game stutter, which makes sense: after all, the command is essentially telling the game to reload every single HUD file, similar to a <code>hud_reloadscheme</code>.</p>"},{"location":"en/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/#achievement-tracker","title":"Achievement Tracker","text":"<p>This method is a bit more complicated, but the concept remains simple.

Basically: Valve added a feature to use, instead of the default class image, a dynamic and 3D player model complete with accurate weapons, hats, and running/swimming postures. Due to performance issues, Valve added a console command to toggle the feature on or off. By replacing the background that accompanies, by default, this feature, with our own image crosshair, we can then toggle the crosshair on or off at will. I would recommend only using this method if you can live without the 3D model. If you do wish to use it, all that is necessary to do this is to replace the following control in <code>HudPlayerClass.res</code> with your crosshair.</p> <p></p> <p>So, using my previous example image crosshair, it would look something like this:</p> <pre><code>\"classmodelpanelBG\"\n{\n\"ControlName\" \"CTFImagePanel\"\n\"fieldName\" \"classmodelpanelBG\"\n\"visible\" \"0\"\n\"enabled\" \"1\"\n\"visible_minmode\" \"0\"\n\"enabled_minmode\" \"1\"\n\"xpos\" \"c0\"\n\"ypos\" \"c0\"\n\"zpos\" \"0\"\n\"wide\" \"100\"\n\"tall\" \"100\"\n\"alpha\" \"255\"\n\"image\" \"replay/thumbnails/*your file name*\"\n\"scaleimage\" \"1\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The only thing to be careful about is that you have <code>visible</code> set to <code>0</code> and <code>enabled</code> set to <code>1</code>. As explained under their respective sections under Basic Parameters, this ensures that you can actually turn it off or on. If <code>enabled</code> and <code>visible</code> are both set to <code>0</code> your crosshair will never show up because it will never be loaded by the HUD. If both are set to <code>1</code> then the crosshair will always be visible and you won\u2019t be able to truly \u201ctoggle\u201d it on and off.</p> <p>Another thing you may want to do is scroll down a little bit in <code>HudPlayerClass.res</code> and change <code>xpos</code> to <code>9999</code> under <code>\"classmodelpanel\"</code>.

You edit things by overriding things in your user overrides \u201clayer\u201d. Your user layer consists of a user modules layer, autoexec layer, game overrides layer, and class config layer. Modules override mastercomfig/preset modules layer. Autoexec layer overrides mastercomfig/addons layer. Game overrides layer overrides mastercomfig game overrides (run on game join/every time you change class), and per-class networking settings, for all classes. Class config layer overrides mastercomfig game overrides (class configs run after game overrides) and per-class networking settings, for a single class.</p> <p>This layered approach means that the config\u2019s settings are more managed (that is most things are done for you, with you changing a few things based on your own preference, so that settings don\u2019t conflict for best possible stability and performance), and contained (you can easily drop in a new version of mastercomfig, and your layers will remain in your overrides folder, so you don\u2019t have to re-edit anything whenever you change a version). See the next few questions for more details.</p> <p>With this approach, you\u2019ll find yourself reading documentation more rather than digging through config files, checking to see how you can do something or change a setting when you encounter something you\u2019d like changed. However, the GitHub source is a good reference for some things. For example, you can see the many comments within the main comfig.cfg for information about settings within mastercomfig, as well as how to override individual things at a finer level than with modules. But be careful about compatibility conflicts between different console variables in this case! You can see what modules are used in your preset so you only override modules that you need.</p>"},{"location":"pt/faq/#why-does-mastercomfig-use-a-vpk","title":"Why does mastercomfig use a VPK?","text":"<p>mastercomfig is not just a configuration file like older FPS configs which only use autoexec.cfg. It is a complete performance and customization scripting mod which requires many custom files to work.</p> <p>Here are some of the features that mastercomfig gains, by being a mod rather a configuration file:</p> <ul> <li> <p>dxsupport overrides, which unlocks <code>r_drawropes</code>, <code>fx_drawimpactdebris</code>, <code>fx_drawimpactdust</code>, <code>fx_drawimpactspark</code>, <code>tf_impactwatertimeenable</code>, <code>dsp_off</code>, <code>cl_particle_retire_cost</code> and <code>mat_slopescaledepthbias_decal</code></p> </li> <li> <p>These allow for performance improvements for ropes, particles, sound, and fixing a bug where 1 decal still appears even if decals are disabled</p> </li> <li> <p>Class spawn scripts, which allow for scripts to be run periodically during a match</p> </li> <li> <p>Modular design which allows for an extensive user overrides system (modules, addons, configs), rather than having to redo edits every time mastercomfig updates and not know what edits you made from the base config</p> </li> <li> <p><code>mm_override</code> script, which fixes crashes while loading for Competitive matchmaking</p> </li> <li> <p>Optimized preload configuration, which improves memory usage and load times</p> </li> <li> <p>No messy cloud sync or config saving propagation which happens in the <code>cfg</code> folder</p> </li> </ul> <p>Now, this only explains why mastercomfig is a mod, which can also be a folder, rather than explaining why mastercomfig is a VPK.</p> <p>mastercomfig is specifically a VPK because:</p> <ul> <li>Encourages people to use the modular customization system in mastercomfig, which does not require manual intervention every update to redo custom settings</li> <li>Easy distribution, and drag and drop into the custom folder, and recommended by Valve:</li> </ul> <p>Quote</p> <p>First, mount all user customizations. This will search for VPKs and subfolders and mount them in alphabetical order. The easiest way to distribute a mod is to pack up the custom content into a VPK. To \u201cinstall\u201d a mod, just drop it in this folder.</p> <p>Source</p> <ul> <li>Better performance, as stated by Valve:</li> </ul> <p>Quote</p> <p>When the game boots, this folder is automatically scanned for VPK files or subfolders. Each subfolder or VPK is added as a search path, so the files inside those VPK\u2019s or subfolders will override the default game files. Mounting a VPK to the filesystem is more efficient than adding a subfolder, as each time the engine needs to open a file, it will need to make a call to the operating system to search the folder. VPKs can therefore be searched by the engine much more efficiently. Each subfolder is a new search path that must be checked each time the engine tries to open a file. So, for optimal load times, always use VPK files and don\u2019t make any subfolders in this folder!</p> <p>Source</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>We search VPK files before ordinary folders, because most files will be found in VPK and we can avoid making thousands of file system calls to attempt to open files in folders where they don\u2019t exist.

If you add \u201c+cpu_frequency_monitoring 2\u201d to your launch options then the CPU\u2019s speed will be measured every two seconds.

Under normal circumstances this percentage should be 90% or higher. If the displayed CPU frequency percentage drops below about 80-85% then it suggests that your CPU may be overheating and being thermally throttled.

If these CPU slowdowns happen when your game is running slowly then it is reasonable to assume that they are the cause and that your CPU is overheating.

Interp is a low-level networking setting which controls how incoming packets are used by the client. Packets have an inherent delay, and may not come at all due to issues along your route, low server framerate, server framerate variance, and ping fluctuations. Interp is a very sensitive networking setting which tunes your buffer for incoming packets. If you set it too low, you will get networking errors, resulting in worse hitreg, because of trying to use game packets which have not come in yet.</p> <p>Imagine it like controlling the size of the gray bar in YouTube. If you set it too high, your video playback will be delayed. If you set it too low, then you will be constantly encountering freezing in video playback as the video download tries to keep up with playback. In the case of TF2, when the client needs to use a new server game packet when there is not one, it will instead extrapolate movement based on previous data, assuming that everything is continuing on its same path, which can be wildly inaccurate.</p> <p>If you are worried about the delay being high, rest assured that the tick delay caused by interpolation is compensated for the following: hitscan, melee, backstabs, flamethrower and the Medigun. Projectiles are simulated on the server, and thus are not compensated. Projectile spawns and despawns are not interpolated, which means that you may notice a client-side delay in projectiles exiting your barrel and subsequently impacting the target. In a game like TF2, this is not a huge issue, and you should be more worried about the accuracy of game state rather than a few milliseconds of client-side delay.</p> <p>Now having said all that, you still have the option to change interp if you really want to and understand what you\u2019re doing. The best way to change interp is to use the snapshot buffer module, which has a few preset values for the most common use case of higher than normal packet loss. If you want a specific interp value, the best place to set it is in <code>autoexec.cfg</code> (make sure it is in the <code>overrides</code> folder), like so:</p> <pre><code>cl_interp_ratio x\ncl_interp x\n</code></pre> <p>And then put this in <code>modules.cfg</code>:</p> <pre><code>snapshot_buffer=custom\n</code></pre> <p>One other thing to note is that client interp is determined by whichever is the greater of cl_interp_ratio divided by cl_updaterate, and the value of cl_interp. cl_interp_ratio and cl_interp have no interaction beyond that.</p>"},{"location":"pt/next_steps/quick_fixes/#scottish-resistance-stickybombs-have-no-outline","title":"Scottish Resistance stickybombs have no outline","text":"<p>Warning</p> <p>Outlines of any kind do not work on DirectX 8.</p> <p>On some mastercomfig presets, outlines are disabled.

I was interested to see if I could make a Custom Intro, and it turns out it\u2019s really easy.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Download The RAD Video Tools program. This program allows you to convert video and audio files to <code>.bik</code> format, which is the format that the opening Valve video is in.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open up RAD Video Tools and find your video of choice. Select the video and press the Bink it! button. (See below)</p> </li> </ol> <p> </p> <p>You can mess with the above settings to get higher quality video, but leaving the settings as the default garners you a decent result.</p> <p>You may find that while the program attempts to render, it will give you an Error when trying to open the file. I originally tried this using videos I had downloaded online, and the program did not like it. I eventually made a small HUDS.TF intro video using Sony Vegas, and saved it as a <code>.avi</code> file. This seemed to have done the trick, and you may get the result you want by putting your videos into a Video Editor first.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Once converted (shouldn\u2019t take long), watch the file back and make sure it\u2019s okay. Audio can be a bit of a pain (may not render), so you can mix audio in after by selecting the generated <code>.bik</code> file, then pressing the Mix in sound button. Just add your sound file of choice and the default settings should do the rest. Again, feel free to mess around with the settings if you want to get better results.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once you\u2019ve got the file you\u2019ve wanted, go into your Custom HUD folder. Create a media folder in the same directory your resource and scripts folders are (example below)</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Inside this folder, copy your <code>.bik</code> file into it, and create a file called startupvids.txt. Inside this file, you\u2019ll only need one line of text, which is <code>media/&lt;FILENAME&gt;.bik</code>, where <code>&lt;FILENAME&gt;</code> is, obviously, the name of your file. (examples below)</p> <p></p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Now open up Team Fortress 2 (make sure you do not have <code>-novid</code> in your launch options), and you\u2019ll see the result!</li> </ol> <p>Watch my example here:</p> <p>I\u2019ve also included an example file for you to use!</p> <p>Note</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to put this into a Custom HUD folder. You can make a separate Custom folder for your intro video to live in individually, so it will run on every Custom HUD you use, or even on the default TF2 HUD, similar to the way you would do a hitsound. <code>tf/custom/introvideo/media/</code> and then your files would work.</p>"},{"location":"pt/tf2/huds/font_crosshairs/","title":"Installing Font Crosshairs","text":"<p>Originally posted by HarvardBB on the huds.tf guide forums</p> <p>HUD Crosshairs are easy to install, but hard to make. For the simpleness of this thread, we will install pre-made crosshairs instead of making our own. Also a note, this installation is only for Windows, sorry Mac, and Linux users.</p> <p>For the sake of this tutorial we will be installing Seeker\u2019s Crosshair (Download, Linux Download) onto my HUD, HARVARDHUD.</p> <p>You Will Need</p> <ul> <li>A HUD</li> <li>Notepad++(Download)</li> <li>The crosshair font file of your choice</li> </ul> <p>Step 1.</p> <p>Locate your HUD files, you can do this easily by going to your Steam Library, right-clicking on Team Fortress 2, select Properties, select the \u201cLocal Files\u201d tab, select \u201cBrowse..\u201d, select the <code>tf</code> folder, select the <code>custom</code> folder, and inside should be your HUD folder.</p> <p>Step 2.</p> <p>First we need to install the font file into the HUD. First, locate the <code>clientscheme.res</code> file by going to <code>harvardhud/resource</code> and you will find it in there. Next, press CTRL+F and search for <code>ECON FONTS</code> and scroll down till you find a section called <code>HUD Fonts</code>, this name will differ from HUD to HUD, but my HUD has all of the HUD Fonts under <code>HUD Fonts</code>. You must then add this section of code into the client scheme here. This will give you the flexibility to have the crosshair with or without an underline, which ever you prefer.</p> <pre><code>\"seeker11\"\n{\n\"1\"\n{\n\"name\"                  \"TF2Crosshairs\"\n\"tall\"                  \"11\"\n\"weight\"                \"0\"\n\"antialias\"             \"1\"\n\"outline\"               \"1\"\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Should look like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Step 3.</p> <p>Now, while still inside the client scheme, scroll down to the very bottom.  You will find something that looks similar to this</p> <p></p> <p>You must add this exact code under the last font definition, and your font definition numbers should go in order, so for me, Seeker\u2019s Crosshair font will be <code>15</code>. The font name is also not a choice, it is what the author of the font signed it as, you can find out the exact name of any font by right-clicking the font, selecting Properties, selecting Details, and the <code>Title</code> of the font is the name.</p> <pre><code>\"15\"\n{\n\"font\" \"resource/crosshairs/TF2Crosshairs.ttf\"\n\"font\" \"resource/crosshairs/tf2crosshairs_linux.ttf\" [$LINUX]\n\"name\" \"TF2Crosshairs\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>See here:</p> <p></p> <p>The result should look something similar to this:</p> <p></p> <p>Remember to save your file!</p> <p>Step 4.</p> <p>Locate the <code>hudlayout.res</code> file by going to <code>harvardhud/scripts</code> and it will be in there. Most HUDs will have there crosshairs right in the front, as mine does as well. My HUD is a little bit more trickier than other HUDs as I have pre-animated, and pre-outlined HUD crosshairs to choose from. You can install the HUD Crosshair anywhere in the file, for the sake of the order of my crosshairs in my HUD, I\u2019m going to be doing it a certain way, you can put it at the very top if you would like.</p> <p>The file when you first open it should look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Now press CTRL+F and search for \u201cYZ50KonrWings\u201d as I will be installing the Seeker\u2019s Crosshair right underneath that, this is only for my HUD, and your HUD will most likely be different. Now insert this section of code into the file.</p> <p>It should look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>If you want to change the color of the crosshair, you have to edit the <code>fgcolor</code>, you can pick out the color by using this to help you select a color, note the first digit is the red value, second digit is green, third is blue, and the final digit is the alpha or transparency value, you should leave that at <code>255</code> unless you actually do want a transparent crosshair (which most do not). Now if the crosshair is not perfectly centered, you must mess with the <code>xpos</code>, <code>ypos</code>, and <code>wide</code>, and <code>tall</code> values. It can sometimes be a very painful process, though I am almost certain that the way the Seeker\u2019s Crosshair is now, it is perfectly centered, so do not mess with it unless you are positive it is not centered.</p> <p>Remember to save the file!</p> <p>Final Step.</p> <p>Now take the font file previously mentioned above and install it in the HUD. Most HUDs tend to have a dedicated <code>fonts</code> folder for their HUD, most HUDs including my own will have it be in <code>harvardhud/resource/fonts</code> and you just drop the file into there. Note, the file path of the installed font in the client scheme must match.</p> <p>See here:</p> <p></p> <p>See how the file path is the same. The end result of the font folder should look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Now enabling the font is by far the easiest part.</p> <p>All you do is go into the <code>hudlayout.res</code> file in <code>harvardhud/scripts</code>, and find the HUD crosshair you want to use, and make the <code>enabled</code> and <code>visible</code> value both <code>1</code>, although most HUDs including my own have all crosshairs enabled, but not visible, so you will most likely only have to change the value of <code>visible</code>.</p> <p>Enabling Seeker\u2019s Crosshair will look like this:</p> <p></p> <p>And of course, do not forget to save the file!</p> <p>Sorry for the long wall of text and the messy guide, but hopefully it will get the job done.</p>"},{"location":"pt/tf2/huds/hud_animations/","title":"Using the HUD Animations Manifest","text":"<p>Originally posted by omnibombulator on huds.tf</p> <p>Having a <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file in your custom HUD has proved somewhat of a hassle in TF2 updates. It\u2019s the primary cause of most in-game crashes and bugs. Even an update that doesn\u2019t change much in the way of actual HUD elements could cause a problem if the <code>hudanimations_tf</code> file is outdated.</p> <p>But there\u2019s a way to avoid this headache, so allow me to guide you through it.</p> <p><code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code>, the magic file When you extract the HUD from TF2 using GCFScape or this handy GitHub, you\u2019ll find the file <code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code> inside the <code>scripts</code> folder. This is the primary file we\u2019ll be using to get around avoiding HUD animation related crashes and having to update your <code>hudanimations_tf</code> file constantly to new updates.</p> <p>The file is extremely simple, including no more than 6 lines of code:</p> <pre><code>hudanimations_manifest\n{\n\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations.txt\"\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations_tf.txt\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p><code>hudanimations_manifest</code> is the file that tells the game what files to read animations from. So, it reads from the default Source <code>hudanimations.txt</code> file and the TF2 <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file. But we can add more files to this list. Our own files.</p> <p>First up, go to your scripts folder, open the <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file and copy any animations that have been modified in your HUD. Commonly modified animations are Health Animations (<code>HudHealthBonusPulse</code>, <code>HudHealthBonusPulseLoop</code>, <code>HudHealthBonusPulseStop</code>, <code>HudHealthDyingPulse</code>, <code>HudHealthDyingPulseLoop</code>, <code>HudHealthDyingPulseStop</code>), Ammo Animations (<code>HudLowAmmoPulse</code>, <code>HudLowAmmoPulseLoop</code>, <code>HudLowAmmoPulseStop</code>) and Medic Animations (<code>HudMedicCharged</code>, <code>HudMedicChargedLoop</code>, <code>HudMedicChargedStop</code>). Paste the modified code into a new text file. For the sake of example, save the file as hudanimations_custom.txt to the scripts folder. Now you have a custom animation file, brilliant!</p> <p>Next step is to delete (or rename if you\u2019re unsure of if you\u2019ve missed some modified code) the custom <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file. We won\u2019t need this anymore, the game can read the original file from the <code>.vpk</code> the game includes from now on. This means the game will keep the animations up to date every time the game has an update that changes them!</p> <p>Now it\u2019s time to go back to the <code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code> file. We need to add the <code>hudanimations_custom.txt</code> file we created to it, so the game can read the animations from it.</p> <p>Quite simply, just add an extra line above the <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file value (as exampled below), then save the file:</p> <pre><code>hudanimations_manifest\n{\n\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations.txt\"\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations_custom.txt\"\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations_tf.txt\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>You can add as many different animation files as you like, so you can keep your Health, Ammo and Medic animations in separate files if you like it tidy that way! However, you must make sure that when you add extra files to <code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code>, that you place them above <code>hudanimations_tf</code>, else they will not overwrite the default TF2 animation file.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve followed everything correctly, your custom animations should work, and the game will keep all future animations updated for you. Of course, if your custom animations get updated, you will have to manually update them, however, common animation modifications such as Health and Ammo are rarely updated.</p>"},{"location":"pt/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/","title":"In-Depth HUD Crosshair Guide","text":"<p>Originally posted by omnibombulator on huds.tf</p> <p>This guide has been ported over from the old HUDS.TF Guides section.

It displays information relevant to the user while in-game, such as health, ammo, the scoreboard, and much more. It is controlled by text documents that determine positioning, size, visibility, color, and everything else about all of its moving bits and pieces. These documents, saved as <code>.res</code> files, can be edited by the user to change existing bits and pieces, which will henceforth referred to as controls, or, more interestingly, at least for our purposes, add new controls. One technique users have been using since as early as 2009 is to place a control into their HUDs to serve as a crosshair. That is, something that will tell them where the center of their screen is.

Antialiasing is pretty different in fonts, and doesn\u2019t always work, so try enabling/disabling it yourself and see.</p> <p>In addition to antialiasing, you might want to change <code>\"outline\"</code> to <code>1</code>, which will put a black outline around your crosshair. It might be a bit buggy or pixelated, however, so, same as your crosshair, test out enabling and disabling it for optimum results.</p> <p>Back to resizing. Something a lot of HUD makers do to make things easier is to create many definitions for the same font. This is because the only way to change the size of a font is to change the font definition. So, an easy shortcut is to name each definition according to the size it is. For example, make one called <code>crosshair12</code>, with the <code>tall</code> value being <code>12</code>, another named <code>crosshair14</code> with the <code>tall</code> value of <code>14</code>, all the way up to <code>54</code>, which is the highest tall value that TF2 accepts. This is useful because TF2 doesn\u2019t reload <code>ClientScheme.res</code> (or the main menu, for that matter, if you\u2019re interested) when you type <code>hud_reloadscheme</code> in console, so you need to restart the game each time you change <code>ClientScheme.res</code>. By creating lots of font definitions you can test out new sizes for text boxes without restarting the game.</p>"},{"location":"pt/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/#changing-color","title":"Changing Color","text":"<p>This time, the roles are reversed.

You are going to want your dimensions to be a square power of 2.          I usually use 1024 by 1024 or 512 by 512, a square file is easier to center regardless of crosshair shape so I\u2019d advise making it square.</p> </li> <li> <p>Before you hit \u201cOK\u201d go to the arrow near \u201cAdvanced Options\u201d, click it, then go to \u201cFill With\u201d and select \u201cTransparency\u201d from the drop-down menu.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now you have your canvas on which to create your crosshair.</p> </li> <li> <p>The very basics are this: create a selection and fill it with a color. To this end, some useful tools are the selection tools, rectangle, ellipse, free select, etc.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Here are some tips and tricks to using these tools:</p> <ul> <li> <p>First off, whenever you are using a tool it\u2019s a good idea to have the \u201cTool Options\u201d window open. If you don\u2019t see it go up to Windows &gt; Dockable Dialogs &gt; Tool Options. This is extremely useful.</p> </li> <li> <p>For making a circle be uniform/perfect you can simply set aspect ratio to be 1:1 or change the dimensions manually in the same (Tool Options) window. Obviously the same can be used to mess with a rectangular selection/make it square.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you are copying and pasting/editing a pre-existing crosshair an extremely useful tool is the \u201cSelect By Color\u201d tool. It selects all pixels in the image of the color that you click on.</p> </li> <li> <p>For any of these selection tools it\u2019s useful to be able to subtract or add to it easily, so take note of the buttons at the top of the \u201cTool Options\u201d window: they change the mode of selection you are currently in, from making a new selection to adding/subtracting/intersecting with the current one. For example, to make a ring you make a circle then change the mode to subtract from selection and put a smaller circle inside. There are an abundance of GIMP tutorials on the subject, and a video does it much better than I can. Another example is that maybe selecting by color didn\u2019t get everything you hoped it would. Change to \u201cAdd to Selection\u201d and you can easily add different shades of the same color which you want to include that weren\u2019t picked up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Another useful trick for selecting by color is that if there is an image and you want to effectively get rid of a inform background you can select the background then hit Edit&gt;Clear to send it to transparent or Select &gt; Invert to invert the selection, effectively selecting every pixel in the image that is NOT the color you selected. The invert selection button is immensely useful in multiple other ways as well.</p> </li> <li> <p>One more useful tool is \u201cAlign\u201d to align your selection or layer to the center of the image for the easiest time making a multiple layered image look neat. For example, to make the backgrounds to the health cross I used in my HUD.   I made a circle selection, went to tool options, changed the size to 300 x 300, went to align tool, center aligned it, then filled the whole thing with blue or black or whichever. Then I made a rectangular selection, made it 75 x 200 ( I think, don\u2019t quite remember), centered it with the align tool. Then I went to edit&gt;clear to send that rectangle in the middle to transparent. Then I made another rectangular selection, 200 x 75 this time, and center aligned it, then \u201ccleared\u201d that one as well. The result satisfies my perfectionistic (is this a word?) OCD tendencies.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"pt/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/#export","title":"Export","text":"<p>From here you can either use the VTF Photoshop/Paint.NET plugin or the GIMP VTF plugin to export to a <code>.vtf</code> file.

It will look like this:</p> <pre><code>\"TextExample\"\n{\n\"controlName\" \"CExLabel\"\n\"fieldName\" \"TextExample\"\n\"visible\" \"1\"\n\"enabled\" \"1\"\n\"visible_minmode\" \"1\"\n\"enabled_minmode\" \"1\"\n\"xpos\" \"c0\"\n\"ypos\" \"c0\"\n\"zpos\" \"0\"\n\"wide\" \"100\"\n\"tall\" \"100\"\n\n\"font\" \"fogCrosshair\"\n\"labelText\" \"+\"\n\"fgcolor\" \"White\"\n\"textAlignment\" \"center\"\n}\n\n\"ImageExample\"\n{\n\"controlName\" \"CTFImagePanel\"\n\"fieldName\" \"ImageExample\"\n\"visible\" \"1\"\n\"enabled\" \"1\"\n\"visible_minmode\" \"1\"\n\"enabled_minmode\" \"1\"\n\"xpos\" \"c0\"\n\"ypos\" \"c0\"\n\"zpos\" \"0\"\n\"wide\" \"100\"\n\"tall\" \"100\"\n\n\"alpha\" \"255\"\n\"image\" \"replay/thumbnails/&lt;your file name&gt;\"\n\"scaleimage\" \"1\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, <code>ImageExample</code>, the image crosshair, would only be visible when minmode is on, or, when <code>cl_hud_minmode</code> is set to <code>1</code>. On the other hand, <code>TextExample</code>, the text crosshair, would only be visible when minmode is off, or, when <code>cl_hud_minmode</code> is set to <code>0</code>. In this way you can use a console command to turn your crosshair on or off as you please. However, this is the method that I referenced earlier as being by class, meaning I recommend putting the command in your class configs to turn the crosshair on or off based on which class you are. The reason is that toggling this command causes in-game stutter, which makes sense: after all, the command is essentially telling the game to reload every single HUD file, similar to a <code>hud_reloadscheme</code>.</p>"},{"location":"pt/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/#achievement-tracker","title":"Achievement Tracker","text":"<p>This method is a bit more complicated, but the concept remains simple. Basically, TF2 has the capacity to display information about your progress on an in-game achievement of your choice, and you can toggle this feature on or off with a console command.

Basically: Valve added a feature to use, instead of the default class image, a dynamic and 3D player model complete with accurate weapons, hats, and running/swimming postures. Due to performance issues, Valve added a console command to toggle the feature on or off. By replacing the background that accompanies, by default, this feature, with our own image crosshair, we can then toggle the crosshair on or off at will. I would recommend only using this method if you can live without the 3D model. If you do wish to use it, all that is necessary to do this is to replace the following control in <code>HudPlayerClass.res</code> with your crosshair.</p> <p></p> <p>So, using my previous example image crosshair, it would look something like this:</p> <pre><code>\"classmodelpanelBG\"\n{\n\"ControlName\" \"CTFImagePanel\"\n\"fieldName\" \"classmodelpanelBG\"\n\"visible\" \"0\"\n\"enabled\" \"1\"\n\"visible_minmode\" \"0\"\n\"enabled_minmode\" \"1\"\n\"xpos\" \"c0\"\n\"ypos\" \"c0\"\n\"zpos\" \"0\"\n\"wide\" \"100\"\n\"tall\" \"100\"\n\"alpha\" \"255\"\n\"image\" \"replay/thumbnails/*your file name*\"\n\"scaleimage\" \"1\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The only thing to be careful about is that you have <code>visible</code> set to <code>0</code> and <code>enabled</code> set to <code>1</code>. As explained under their respective sections under Basic Parameters, this ensures that you can actually turn it off or on. If <code>enabled</code> and <code>visible</code> are both set to <code>0</code> your crosshair will never show up because it will never be loaded by the HUD. If both are set to <code>1</code> then the crosshair will always be visible and you won\u2019t be able to truly \u201ctoggle\u201d it on and off.</p> <p>Another thing you may want to do is scroll down a little bit in <code>HudPlayerClass.res</code> and change <code>xpos</code> to <code>9999</code> under <code>\"classmodelpanel\"</code>. This will move the actual 3D model off the screen so it doesn\u2019t turn on and off too. This way only your crosshair will be visible.</p>"},{"location":"pt/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/#in-game-image-crosshair","title":"In-Game Image Crosshair","text":"<p>It turns out, by using the console, that you can actually reference one of your images that you\u2019ve saved to the directory <code>materials/vgui/replay/thumbnails</code> as an in-game crosshair. That is, it\u2019s possible to \u201ctrick\u201d the game into using your image instead of a default crosshair. This allows you to modify it using the Options window (or console commands) to control color and size. You cannot, however, switch between your new custom crosshair and other default ones.</p> <p>All you need to do to use this method if you so desire is to make sure the .vtf and the accompanying .vmt are correctly created and placed and then type in console the following:</p> <pre><code>cl_crosshair_file ../replay/thumbnails/&lt;crosshair name&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Make sure to replace <code>&lt;crosshair name&gt;</code> with the name of your file and double-check that you have set up the .vmt file correctly. The only other weird restriction is that, although it will work on servers with <code>sv_pure</code>, you need to load it up in a server without <code>sv_pure</code> first. As soon as you\u2019ve done this you\u2019re good to join any server and your crosshair should remain, at which point you can change the color with console commands or a crosshair switching script. You could make it bigger and red for your melee and smaller and red for your primary, for example, or have it change to a different color for every direction that you move like stabby does.</p>"},{"location":"pt/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/#postnotes","title":"Postnotes","text":"<p>The explanation images were all created using the font \u201cNovecento\u201d as an example, this is the font that Garm3n introduced in his Rex, 8MD, VIP, and KTC HUDS and their variants.

Intro for Team Fortress 2","text":"<p>Originally posted by omnibombulator on huds.tf</p> <p>I was messing around with the TF2 files and stumbled across how the game chooses it\u2019s intro video to play on launch. I was interested to see if I could make a Custom Intro, and it turns out it\u2019s really easy.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Download The RAD Video Tools program. This program allows you to convert video and audio files to <code>.bik</code> format, which is the format that the opening Valve video is in.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open up RAD Video Tools and find your video of choice. Select the video and press the Bink it! button. (See below)</p> </li> </ol> <p> </p> <p>You can mess with the above settings to get higher quality video, but leaving the settings as the default garners you a decent result.</p> <p>You may find that while the program attempts to render, it will give you an Error when trying to open the file. I originally tried this using videos I had downloaded online, and the program did not like it. I eventually made a small HUDS.TF intro video using Sony Vegas, and saved it as a <code>.avi</code> file. This seemed to have done the trick, and you may get the result you want by putting your videos into a Video Editor first.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Once converted (shouldn\u2019t take long), watch the file back and make sure it\u2019s okay. Audio can be a bit of a pain (may not render), so you can mix audio in after by selecting the generated <code>.bik</code> file, then pressing the Mix in sound button. Just add your sound file of choice and the default settings should do the rest. Again, feel free to mess around with the settings if you want to get better results.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once you\u2019ve got the file you\u2019ve wanted, go into your Custom HUD folder. Create a media folder in the same directory your resource and scripts folders are (example below)</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Inside this folder, copy your <code>.bik</code> file into it, and create a file called startupvids.txt. Inside this file, you\u2019ll only need one line of text, which is <code>media/&lt;FILENAME&gt;.bik</code>, where <code>&lt;FILENAME&gt;</code> is, obviously, the name of your file. (examples below)</p> <p></p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Now open up Team Fortress 2 (make sure you do not have <code>-novid</code> in your launch options), and you\u2019ll see the result!</li> </ol> <p>Watch my example here:</p> <p>I\u2019ve also included an example file for you to use!</p> <p>Note</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to put this into a Custom HUD folder. You can make a separate Custom folder for your intro video to live in individually, so it will run on every Custom HUD you use, or even on the default TF2 HUD, similar to the way you would do a hitsound. <code>tf/custom/introvideo/media/</code> and then your files would work.</p>"},{"location":"ru/tf2/huds/font_crosshairs/","title":"Installing Font Crosshairs","text":"<p>Originally posted by HarvardBB on the huds.tf guide forums</p> <p>HUD Crosshairs are easy to install, but hard to make. For the simpleness of this thread, we will install pre-made crosshairs instead of making our own. Also a note, this installation is only for Windows, sorry Mac, and Linux users.</p> <p>For the sake of this tutorial we will be installing Seeker\u2019s Crosshair (Download, Linux Download) onto my HUD, HARVARDHUD.</p> <p>You Will Need</p> <ul> <li>A HUD</li> <li>Notepad++(Download)</li> <li>The crosshair font file of your choice</li> </ul> <p>Step 1.</p> <p>Locate your HUD files, you can do this easily by going to your Steam Library, right-clicking on Team Fortress 2, select Properties, select the \u201cLocal Files\u201d tab, select \u201cBrowse..\u201d, select the <code>tf</code> folder, select the <code>custom</code> folder, and inside should be your HUD folder.</p> <p>Step 2.</p> <p>First we need to install the font file into the HUD. First, locate the <code>clientscheme.res</code> file by going to <code>harvardhud/resource</code> and you will find it in there. Next, press CTRL+F and search for <code>ECON FONTS</code> and scroll down till you find a section called <code>HUD Fonts</code>, this name will differ from HUD to HUD, but my HUD has all of the HUD Fonts under <code>HUD Fonts</code>. You must then add this section of code into the client scheme here. This will give you the flexibility to have the crosshair with or without an underline, which ever you prefer.</p> <pre><code>\"seeker11\"\n{\n\"1\"\n{\n\"name\"                  \"TF2Crosshairs\"\n\"tall\"                  \"11\"\n\"weight\"                \"0\"\n\"antialias\"             \"1\"\n\"outline\"               \"1\"\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Should look like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Step 3.</p> <p>Now, while still inside the client scheme, scroll down to the very bottom.  You will find something that looks similar to this</p> <p></p> <p>You must add this exact code under the last font definition, and your font definition numbers should go in order, so for me, Seeker\u2019s Crosshair font will be <code>15</code>. The font name is also not a choice, it is what the author of the font signed it as, you can find out the exact name of any font by right-clicking the font, selecting Properties, selecting Details, and the <code>Title</code> of the font is the name.</p> <pre><code>\"15\"\n{\n\"font\" \"resource/crosshairs/TF2Crosshairs.ttf\"\n\"font\" \"resource/crosshairs/tf2crosshairs_linux.ttf\" [$LINUX]\n\"name\" \"TF2Crosshairs\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>See here:</p> <p></p> <p>The result should look something similar to this:</p> <p></p> <p>Remember to save your file!</p> <p>Step 4.</p> <p>Locate the <code>hudlayout.res</code> file by going to <code>harvardhud/scripts</code> and it will be in there. Most HUDs will have there crosshairs right in the front, as mine does as well. My HUD is a little bit more trickier than other HUDs as I have pre-animated, and pre-outlined HUD crosshairs to choose from. You can install the HUD Crosshair anywhere in the file, for the sake of the order of my crosshairs in my HUD, I\u2019m going to be doing it a certain way, you can put it at the very top if you would like.</p> <p>The file when you first open it should look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Now press CTRL+F and search for \u201cYZ50KonrWings\u201d as I will be installing the Seeker\u2019s Crosshair right underneath that, this is only for my HUD, and your HUD will most likely be different. Now insert this section of code into the file.</p> <p>It should look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>If you want to change the color of the crosshair, you have to edit the <code>fgcolor</code>, you can pick out the color by using this to help you select a color, note the first digit is the red value, second digit is green, third is blue, and the final digit is the alpha or transparency value, you should leave that at <code>255</code> unless you actually do want a transparent crosshair (which most do not). Now if the crosshair is not perfectly centered, you must mess with the <code>xpos</code>, <code>ypos</code>, and <code>wide</code>, and <code>tall</code> values. It can sometimes be a very painful process, though I am almost certain that the way the Seeker\u2019s Crosshair is now, it is perfectly centered, so do not mess with it unless you are positive it is not centered.</p> <p>Remember to save the file!</p> <p>Final Step.</p> <p>Now take the font file previously mentioned above and install it in the HUD. Most HUDs tend to have a dedicated <code>fonts</code> folder for their HUD, most HUDs including my own will have it be in <code>harvardhud/resource/fonts</code> and you just drop the file into there. Note, the file path of the installed font in the client scheme must match.</p> <p>See here:</p> <p></p> <p>See how the file path is the same. The end result of the font folder should look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Now enabling the font is by far the easiest part.</p> <p>All you do is go into the <code>hudlayout.res</code> file in <code>harvardhud/scripts</code>, and find the HUD crosshair you want to use, and make the <code>enabled</code> and <code>visible</code> value both <code>1</code>, although most HUDs including my own have all crosshairs enabled, but not visible, so you will most likely only have to change the value of <code>visible</code>.</p> <p>Enabling Seeker\u2019s Crosshair will look like this:</p> <p></p> <p>And of course, do not forget to save the file!</p> <p>Sorry for the long wall of text and the messy guide, but hopefully it will get the job done.</p>"},{"location":"ru/tf2/huds/hud_animations/","title":"Using the HUD Animations Manifest","text":"<p>Originally posted by omnibombulator on huds.tf</p> <p>Having a <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file in your custom HUD has proved somewhat of a hassle in TF2 updates. It\u2019s the primary cause of most in-game crashes and bugs. Even an update that doesn\u2019t change much in the way of actual HUD elements could cause a problem if the <code>hudanimations_tf</code> file is outdated.</p> <p>But there\u2019s a way to avoid this headache, so allow me to guide you through it.</p> <p><code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code>, the magic file When you extract the HUD from TF2 using GCFScape or this handy GitHub, you\u2019ll find the file <code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code> inside the <code>scripts</code> folder. This is the primary file we\u2019ll be using to get around avoiding HUD animation related crashes and having to update your <code>hudanimations_tf</code> file constantly to new updates.</p> <p>The file is extremely simple, including no more than 6 lines of code:</p> <pre><code>hudanimations_manifest\n{\n\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations.txt\"\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations_tf.txt\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p><code>hudanimations_manifest</code> is the file that tells the game what files to read animations from. So, it reads from the default Source <code>hudanimations.txt</code> file and the TF2 <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file. But we can add more files to this list. Our own files.</p> <p>First up, go to your scripts folder, open the <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file and copy any animations that have been modified in your HUD. Commonly modified animations are Health Animations (<code>HudHealthBonusPulse</code>, <code>HudHealthBonusPulseLoop</code>, <code>HudHealthBonusPulseStop</code>, <code>HudHealthDyingPulse</code>, <code>HudHealthDyingPulseLoop</code>, <code>HudHealthDyingPulseStop</code>), Ammo Animations (<code>HudLowAmmoPulse</code>, <code>HudLowAmmoPulseLoop</code>, <code>HudLowAmmoPulseStop</code>) and Medic Animations (<code>HudMedicCharged</code>, <code>HudMedicChargedLoop</code>, <code>HudMedicChargedStop</code>). Paste the modified code into a new text file. For the sake of example, save the file as hudanimations_custom.txt to the scripts folder. Now you have a custom animation file, brilliant!</p> <p>Next step is to delete (or rename if you\u2019re unsure of if you\u2019ve missed some modified code) the custom <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file. We won\u2019t need this anymore, the game can read the original file from the <code>.vpk</code> the game includes from now on. This means the game will keep the animations up to date every time the game has an update that changes them!</p> <p>Now it\u2019s time to go back to the <code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code> file. We need to add the <code>hudanimations_custom.txt</code> file we created to it, so the game can read the animations from it.</p> <p>Quite simply, just add an extra line above the <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file value (as exampled below), then save the file:</p> <pre><code>hudanimations_manifest\n{\n\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations.txt\"\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations_custom.txt\"\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations_tf.txt\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>You can add as many different animation files as you like, so you can keep your Health, Ammo and Medic animations in separate files if you like it tidy that way! However, you must make sure that when you add extra files to <code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code>, that you place them above <code>hudanimations_tf</code>, else they will not overwrite the default TF2 animation file.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve followed everything correctly, your custom animations should work, and the game will keep all future animations updated for you. Of course, if your custom animations get updated, you will have to manually update them, however, common animation modifications such as Health and Ammo are rarely updated.</p>"},{"location":"ru/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/","title":"In-Depth HUD Crosshair Guide","text":"<p>Originally posted by omnibombulator on huds.tf</p> <p>This guide has been ported over from the old HUDS.TF Guides section.

It displays information relevant to the user while in-game, such as health, ammo, the scoreboard, and much more. It is controlled by text documents that determine positioning, size, visibility, color, and everything else about all of its moving bits and pieces. These documents, saved as <code>.res</code> files, can be edited by the user to change existing bits and pieces, which will henceforth referred to as controls, or, more interestingly, at least for our purposes, add new controls. One technique users have been using since as early as 2009 is to place a control into their HUDs to serve as a crosshair. That is, something that will tell them where the center of their screen is.

Something a lot of HUD makers do to make things easier is to create many definitions for the same font. This is because the only way to change the size of a font is to change the font definition. So, an easy shortcut is to name each definition according to the size it is. For example, make one called <code>crosshair12</code>, with the <code>tall</code> value being <code>12</code>, another named <code>crosshair14</code> with the <code>tall</code> value of <code>14</code>, all the way up to <code>54</code>, which is the highest tall value that TF2 accepts. This is useful because TF2 doesn\u2019t reload <code>ClientScheme.res</code> (or the main menu, for that matter, if you\u2019re interested) when you type <code>hud_reloadscheme</code> in console, so you need to restart the game each time you change <code>ClientScheme.res</code>.

The third possibility is only relevant if it\u2019s a text crosshair and you\u2019re using macOS or Linux; sometimes fonts get cut off in TF2 on macOS/Linux: this is due to differences in how Windows handles fonts compared to these operating systems, and therefore how TF2 expects its fonts to be handled.

Another, simpler way to explain is that this property uses the cardinal directions for values, as well as <code>Left</code> and <code>Right</code>. To enter more than one alignment you must use the cardinal directions with the vertical alignment first, for example <code>North-West</code> for top left alignment. Basically, think of the text as being inside of a box.

You are going to want your dimensions to be a square power of 2.          I usually use 1024 by 1024 or 512 by 512, a square file is easier to center regardless of crosshair shape so I\u2019d advise making it square.</p> </li> <li> <p>Before you hit \u201cOK\u201d go to the arrow near \u201cAdvanced Options\u201d, click it, then go to \u201cFill With\u201d and select \u201cTransparency\u201d from the drop-down menu.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now you have your canvas on which to create your crosshair.</p> </li> <li> <p>The very basics are this: create a selection and fill it with a color. To this end, some useful tools are the selection tools, rectangle, ellipse, free select, etc.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Here are some tips and tricks to using these tools:</p> <ul> <li> <p>First off, whenever you are using a tool it\u2019s a good idea to have the \u201cTool Options\u201d window open. If you don\u2019t see it go up to Windows &gt; Dockable Dialogs &gt; Tool Options. This is extremely useful.</p> </li> <li> <p>For making a circle be uniform/perfect you can simply set aspect ratio to be 1:1 or change the dimensions manually in the same (Tool Options) window. Obviously the same can be used to mess with a rectangular selection/make it square.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you are copying and pasting/editing a pre-existing crosshair an extremely useful tool is the \u201cSelect By Color\u201d tool. It selects all pixels in the image of the color that you click on.</p> </li> <li> <p>For any of these selection tools it\u2019s useful to be able to subtract or add to it easily, so take note of the buttons at the top of the \u201cTool Options\u201d window: they change the mode of selection you are currently in, from making a new selection to adding/subtracting/intersecting with the current one. For example, to make a ring you make a circle then change the mode to subtract from selection and put a smaller circle inside. There are an abundance of GIMP tutorials on the subject, and a video does it much better than I can. Another example is that maybe selecting by color didn\u2019t get everything you hoped it would. Change to \u201cAdd to Selection\u201d and you can easily add different shades of the same color which you want to include that weren\u2019t picked up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Another useful trick for selecting by color is that if there is an image and you want to effectively get rid of a inform background you can select the background then hit Edit&gt;Clear to send it to transparent or Select &gt; Invert to invert the selection, effectively selecting every pixel in the image that is NOT the color you selected. The invert selection button is immensely useful in multiple other ways as well.</p> </li> <li> <p>One more useful tool is \u201cAlign\u201d to align your selection or layer to the center of the image for the easiest time making a multiple layered image look neat. For example, to make the backgrounds to the health cross I used in my HUD.   I made a circle selection, went to tool options, changed the size to 300 x 300, went to align tool, center aligned it, then filled the whole thing with blue or black or whichever. Then I made a rectangular selection, made it 75 x 200 ( I think, don\u2019t quite remember), centered it with the align tool. Then I went to edit&gt;clear to send that rectangle in the middle to transparent. Then I made another rectangular selection, 200 x 75 this time, and center aligned it, then \u201ccleared\u201d that one as well. The result satisfies my perfectionistic (is this a word?) OCD tendencies.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"ru/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/#export","title":"Export","text":"<p>From here you can either use the VTF Photoshop/Paint.NET plugin or the GIMP VTF plugin to export to a <code>.vtf</code> file.

It is the <code>.vmt</code> file that the game actually looks at, not the <code>.vtf</code>.  personally don\u2019t use VTFEdit\u2019s function to create your own <code>.vmt</code> as I do it by hand but you certainly can do so if you wish. It is under Tools &gt; Create VMT File. If you use it you simply select your saved <code>.vtf</code> as the base texture. If you wish to do it by hand, simply make a new text document and paste this in:</p> <pre><code>\"UnlitGeneric\"\n{\n\"$translucent\" 1\n\"$basetexture\" \"vgui\\replay\\thumbnails\\&lt;your file name&gt;\"\n\"$yertexcolor\" 1\n\"$no_fullbright\" 1\n\"$ignorez\" 1\n}\n</code></pre> <p>For more advanced users: there are many interesting things that can be done with VMTs, such as making everything beneath it transparent, or making it spin or change color when you are moving. More info on that can be found here. To note: I couldn\u2019t personally get the proxy <code>PlayerDamageTime</code> to work at all, which is disappointing because if it had worked one could create a material in their HUD that would change color or become visible only when the player had crit-heals. I personally was going to make an outline for the health cross, or a bar under the health, although something near the crosshair would be cool too. JarateKing, who knows much more about material proxies than I do, likewise failed, so that particular proxy might not work in TF2, unfortunately.</p> <p>Here is an example <code>.vmt</code> where the crosshair would rotate, pulse blue, and flash green when you are moving:</p> <pre><code>\"UnlitGeneric\"\n{\n\"$translucent\" \"1\"\n\"$basetexture\" \"vgui\\replay\\thumbnails\\crosshair_kent_010\"\n\n\"$angle\" \"0.0\"\n\"$translate\" \"[0.0 0.0]\"\n\"$center\" \"[0.5 0.5]\"\n\n\"$color\" \"[0.0 0.0 0.0]\"\n\"$speed\" \"0\"\n\n\"$vertexcolor\" \"1\"\n\"$no_fullbright\" \"1\"\n\"$vertexalpha\" \"1\"\n\"$ignorez\" \"1\"\n\n\"Proxies\"\n{\n// Rotates the crosshair\n\"LinearRamp\"\n{\n\"rate\" \"600\" // Adjust this, higher spins faster\n\"initialValue\" \"0.0\"\n\"resultVar\" \"$angle\"\n}\n\"TextureTransform\"\n{\n\"translateVar\" \"$translate\"\n\"rotateVar\" \"$angle\"\n\"centerVar\" \"$center\"\n\"resultVar\" \"$basetexturetransform\"\n}\n\n// Makes the crosshair pulse blue\n\"Sine\"\n{\n\"sinemin\" \"0.3\"\n\"minemax\" \"0.5\"\n\"sineperiod\" \"1\"\n\"resultVar\" \"$color[2]\"\n}\n\n// Makes the crosshair light up green when the player is moving\n\"PlayerSpeed\"\n{\n\"resultVar\" \"$speed\"\n}\n\"Clamp\"\n{\n\"min\" \"0.5\"\n\"max\" \"1.0\"\n\"srcVar1\" \"$speed\"\n\"resultVar\" \"$color[1]\"\n}\n\n// Enable animation in the crosshair, set framerate\n//\"AnimatedTexture\"\n//{\n// \"animatedtexturevar\" \"$basetexture\"\n// \"animatedtextureframenumvar\" \"$frame\"\n// \"animatedtextureframerate\" \"30\"\n//}\n}\n\n}\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>More info on this specific crosshair found in this YouTube video.</p> <p>Another example:</p> <p></p> <p>More info on this specific <code>.vmt</code> including a download link can be found here.</p> <p>Here is an example <code>.vmt</code> where it would mask everything beneath it and make it transparent, which can be used to make anything in your HUD partially transparent, even your viewmodels.</p> <pre><code>\"Refract\"\n{\n\"%keywords\" \"tf\"\n\"$refractamount\" \"0.0\"\n\"$refracttint\" \"{255 255 255}\"\n\"$refractblur\" \"0.0\"\n\n\"$scale\" \"[1 1]\"\n\"$normalmap\" \"vgui/replay/thumbnails/REFRACTnormal\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Here is more information on transparent viewmodels with this method.</p> <p>The path to create your own text crosshair is one I confess I personally have never done. I do, however, understand the basic concept. What you will need to do is to create a vector image of the crosshair that you want to use, the application to use for that is probably Adobe Illustrator, a free application I have used is Inkscape, which is compatible with GIMP. I wouldn\u2019t highly recommend Inkscape but you can easily Google alternatives yourself. Then get your hands on a font editor, FontForge probably being the best, although there are many other alternatives. Import your vector image into your custom font and save it as a <code>.ttf</code> or <code>.otf</code> and vo\u00edla. Google will need to be your friend on this one as I cannot help you much, sorry.</p>"},{"location":"ru/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/#toggling","title":"Toggling","text":"<p>Toggling your HUD crosshair means turning it on or off at will.

On the other hand, <code>TextExample</code>, the text crosshair, would only be visible when minmode is off, or, when <code>cl_hud_minmode</code> is set to <code>0</code>. In this way you can use a console command to turn your crosshair on or off as you please. However, this is the method that I referenced earlier as being by class, meaning I recommend putting the command in your class configs to turn the crosshair on or off based on which class you are. The reason is that toggling this command causes in-game stutter, which makes sense: after all, the command is essentially telling the game to reload every single HUD file, similar to a <code>hud_reloadscheme</code>.</p>"},{"location":"ru/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/#achievement-tracker","title":"Achievement Tracker","text":"<p>This method is a bit more complicated, but the concept remains simple.

Basically: Valve added a feature to use, instead of the default class image, a dynamic and 3D player model complete with accurate weapons, hats, and running/swimming postures. Due to performance issues, Valve added a console command to toggle the feature on or off. By replacing the background that accompanies, by default, this feature, with our own image crosshair, we can then toggle the crosshair on or off at will. I would recommend only using this method if you can live without the 3D model. If you do wish to use it, all that is necessary to do this is to replace the following control in <code>HudPlayerClass.res</code> with your crosshair.</p> <p></p> <p>So, using my previous example image crosshair, it would look something like this:</p> <pre><code>\"classmodelpanelBG\"\n{\n\"ControlName\" \"CTFImagePanel\"\n\"fieldName\" \"classmodelpanelBG\"\n\"visible\" \"0\"\n\"enabled\" \"1\"\n\"visible_minmode\" \"0\"\n\"enabled_minmode\" \"1\"\n\"xpos\" \"c0\"\n\"ypos\" \"c0\"\n\"zpos\" \"0\"\n\"wide\" \"100\"\n\"tall\" \"100\"\n\"alpha\" \"255\"\n\"image\" \"replay/thumbnails/*your file name*\"\n\"scaleimage\" \"1\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The only thing to be careful about is that you have <code>visible</code> set to <code>0</code> and <code>enabled</code> set to <code>1</code>. As explained under their respective sections under Basic Parameters, this ensures that you can actually turn it off or on. If <code>enabled</code> and <code>visible</code> are both set to <code>0</code> your crosshair will never show up because it will never be loaded by the HUD. If both are set to <code>1</code> then the crosshair will always be visible and you won\u2019t be able to truly \u201ctoggle\u201d it on and off.</p> <p>Another thing you may want to do is scroll down a little bit in <code>HudPlayerClass.res</code> and change <code>xpos</code> to <code>9999</code> under <code>\"classmodelpanel\"</code>.

You edit things by overriding things in your user overrides \u201clayer\u201d. Your user layer consists of a user modules layer, autoexec layer, game overrides layer, and class config layer. Modules override mastercomfig/preset modules layer. Autoexec layer overrides mastercomfig/addons layer. Game overrides layer overrides mastercomfig game overrides (run on game join/every time you change class), and per-class networking settings, for all classes. Class config layer overrides mastercomfig game overrides (class configs run after game overrides) and per-class networking settings, for a single class.</p> <p>This layered approach means that the config\u2019s settings are more managed (that is most things are done for you, with you changing a few things based on your own preference, so that settings don\u2019t conflict for best possible stability and performance), and contained (you can easily drop in a new version of mastercomfig, and your layers will remain in your overrides folder, so you don\u2019t have to re-edit anything whenever you change a version). See the next few questions for more details.</p> <p>With this approach, you\u2019ll find yourself reading documentation more rather than digging through config files, checking to see how you can do something or change a setting when you encounter something you\u2019d like changed. However, the GitHub source is a good reference for some things. For example, you can see the many comments within the main comfig.cfg for information about settings within mastercomfig, as well as how to override individual things at a finer level than with modules. But be careful about compatibility conflicts between different console variables in this case! You can see what modules are used in your preset so you only override modules that you need.</p>"},{"location":"es/faq/#why-does-mastercomfig-use-a-vpk","title":"Why does mastercomfig use a VPK?","text":"<p>mastercomfig is not just a configuration file like older FPS configs which only use autoexec.cfg. It is a complete performance and customization scripting mod which requires many custom files to work.</p> <p>Here are some of the features that mastercomfig gains, by being a mod rather a configuration file:</p> <ul> <li> <p>dxsupport overrides, which unlocks <code>r_drawropes</code>, <code>fx_drawimpactdebris</code>, <code>fx_drawimpactdust</code>, <code>fx_drawimpactspark</code>, <code>tf_impactwatertimeenable</code>, <code>dsp_off</code>, <code>cl_particle_retire_cost</code> and <code>mat_slopescaledepthbias_decal</code></p> </li> <li> <p>These allow for performance improvements for ropes, particles, sound, and fixing a bug where 1 decal still appears even if decals are disabled</p> </li> <li> <p>Class spawn scripts, which allow for scripts to be run periodically during a match</p> </li> <li> <p>Modular design which allows for an extensive user overrides system (modules, addons, configs), rather than having to redo edits every time mastercomfig updates and not know what edits you made from the base config</p> </li> <li> <p><code>mm_override</code> script, which fixes crashes while loading for Competitive matchmaking</p> </li> <li> <p>Optimized preload configuration, which improves memory usage and load times</p> </li> <li> <p>No messy cloud sync or config saving propagation which happens in the <code>cfg</code> folder</p> </li> </ul> <p>Now, this only explains why mastercomfig is a mod, which can also be a folder, rather than explaining why mastercomfig is a VPK.</p> <p>mastercomfig is specifically a VPK because:</p> <ul> <li>Encourages people to use the modular customization system in mastercomfig, which does not require manual intervention every update to redo custom settings</li> <li>Easy distribution, and drag and drop into the custom folder, and recommended by Valve:</li> </ul> <p>Quote</p> <p>First, mount all user customizations. This will search for VPKs and subfolders and mount them in alphabetical order. The easiest way to distribute a mod is to pack up the custom content into a VPK. To \u201cinstall\u201d a mod, just drop it in this folder.</p> <p>Source</p> <ul> <li>Better performance, as stated by Valve:</li> </ul> <p>Quote</p> <p>When the game boots, this folder is automatically scanned for VPK files or subfolders. Each subfolder or VPK is added as a search path, so the files inside those VPK\u2019s or subfolders will override the default game files. Mounting a VPK to the filesystem is more efficient than adding a subfolder, as each time the engine needs to open a file, it will need to make a call to the operating system to search the folder. VPKs can therefore be searched by the engine much more efficiently. Each subfolder is a new search path that must be checked each time the engine tries to open a file. So, for optimal load times, always use VPK files and don\u2019t make any subfolders in this folder!</p> <p>Source</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>We search VPK files before ordinary folders, because most files will be found in VPK and we can avoid making thousands of file system calls to attempt to open files in folders where they don\u2019t exist.

If the displayed CPU frequency percentage drops below about 80-85% then it suggests that your CPU may be overheating and being thermally throttled.

Interp is a low-level networking setting which controls how incoming packets are used by the client. Packets have an inherent delay, and may not come at all due to issues along your route, low server framerate, server framerate variance, and ping fluctuations. Interp is a very sensitive networking setting which tunes your buffer for incoming packets. If you set it too low, you will get networking errors, resulting in worse hitreg, because of trying to use game packets which have not come in yet.</p> <p>Imagine it like controlling the size of the gray bar in YouTube. If you set it too high, your video playback will be delayed. If you set it too low, then you will be constantly encountering freezing in video playback as the video download tries to keep up with playback. In the case of TF2, when the client needs to use a new server game packet when there is not one, it will instead extrapolate movement based on previous data, assuming that everything is continuing on its same path, which can be wildly inaccurate.</p> <p>If you are worried about the delay being high, rest assured that the tick delay caused by interpolation is compensated for the following: hitscan, melee, backstabs, flamethrower and the Medigun. Projectiles are simulated on the server, and thus are not compensated. Projectile spawns and despawns are not interpolated, which means that you may notice a client-side delay in projectiles exiting your barrel and subsequently impacting the target. In a game like TF2, this is not a huge issue, and you should be more worried about the accuracy of game state rather than a few milliseconds of client-side delay.</p> <p>Now having said all that, you still have the option to change interp if you really want to and understand what you\u2019re doing. The best way to change interp is to use the snapshot buffer module, which has a few preset values for the most common use case of higher than normal packet loss. If you want a specific interp value, the best place to set it is in <code>autoexec.cfg</code> (make sure it is in the <code>overrides</code> folder), like so:</p> <pre><code>cl_interp_ratio x\ncl_interp x\n</code></pre> <p>And then put this in <code>modules.cfg</code>:</p> <pre><code>snapshot_buffer=custom\n</code></pre> <p>One other thing to note is that client interp is determined by whichever is the greater of cl_interp_ratio divided by cl_updaterate, and the value of cl_interp. cl_interp_ratio and cl_interp have no interaction beyond that.</p>"},{"location":"es/next_steps/quick_fixes/#scottish-resistance-stickybombs-have-no-outline","title":"Scottish Resistance stickybombs have no outline","text":"<p>Warning</p> <p>Outlines of any kind do not work on DirectX 8.</p> <p>On some mastercomfig presets, outlines are disabled.

I was interested to see if I could make a Custom Intro, and it turns out it\u2019s really easy.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Download The RAD Video Tools program. This program allows you to convert video and audio files to <code>.bik</code> format, which is the format that the opening Valve video is in.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open up RAD Video Tools and find your video of choice. Select the video and press the Bink it! button. (See below)</p> </li> </ol> <p> </p> <p>You can mess with the above settings to get higher quality video, but leaving the settings as the default garners you a decent result.</p> <p>You may find that while the program attempts to render, it will give you an Error when trying to open the file. I originally tried this using videos I had downloaded online, and the program did not like it. I eventually made a small HUDS.TF intro video using Sony Vegas, and saved it as a <code>.avi</code> file. This seemed to have done the trick, and you may get the result you want by putting your videos into a Video Editor first.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Once converted (shouldn\u2019t take long), watch the file back and make sure it\u2019s okay. Audio can be a bit of a pain (may not render), so you can mix audio in after by selecting the generated <code>.bik</code> file, then pressing the Mix in sound button. Just add your sound file of choice and the default settings should do the rest. Again, feel free to mess around with the settings if you want to get better results.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once you\u2019ve got the file you\u2019ve wanted, go into your Custom HUD folder. Create a media folder in the same directory your resource and scripts folders are (example below)</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Inside this folder, copy your <code>.bik</code> file into it, and create a file called startupvids.txt. Inside this file, you\u2019ll only need one line of text, which is <code>media/&lt;FILENAME&gt;.bik</code>, where <code>&lt;FILENAME&gt;</code> is, obviously, the name of your file. (examples below)</p> <p></p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Now open up Team Fortress 2 (make sure you do not have <code>-novid</code> in your launch options), and you\u2019ll see the result!</li> </ol> <p>Watch my example here:</p> <p>I\u2019ve also included an example file for you to use!</p> <p>Note</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to put this into a Custom HUD folder. You can make a separate Custom folder for your intro video to live in individually, so it will run on every Custom HUD you use, or even on the default TF2 HUD, similar to the way you would do a hitsound. <code>tf/custom/introvideo/media/</code> and then your files would work.</p>"},{"location":"es/tf2/huds/font_crosshairs/","title":"Installing Font Crosshairs","text":"<p>Originally posted by HarvardBB on the huds.tf guide forums</p> <p>HUD Crosshairs are easy to install, but hard to make. For the simpleness of this thread, we will install pre-made crosshairs instead of making our own. Also a note, this installation is only for Windows, sorry Mac, and Linux users.</p> <p>For the sake of this tutorial we will be installing Seeker\u2019s Crosshair (Download, Linux Download) onto my HUD, HARVARDHUD.</p> <p>You Will Need</p> <ul> <li>A HUD</li> <li>Notepad++(Download)</li> <li>The crosshair font file of your choice</li> </ul> <p>Step 1.</p> <p>Locate your HUD files, you can do this easily by going to your Steam Library, right-clicking on Team Fortress 2, select Properties, select the \u201cLocal Files\u201d tab, select \u201cBrowse..\u201d, select the <code>tf</code> folder, select the <code>custom</code> folder, and inside should be your HUD folder.</p> <p>Step 2.</p> <p>First we need to install the font file into the HUD. First, locate the <code>clientscheme.res</code> file by going to <code>harvardhud/resource</code> and you will find it in there. Next, press CTRL+F and search for <code>ECON FONTS</code> and scroll down till you find a section called <code>HUD Fonts</code>, this name will differ from HUD to HUD, but my HUD has all of the HUD Fonts under <code>HUD Fonts</code>. You must then add this section of code into the client scheme here. This will give you the flexibility to have the crosshair with or without an underline, which ever you prefer.</p> <pre><code>\"seeker11\"\n{\n\"1\"\n{\n\"name\"                  \"TF2Crosshairs\"\n\"tall\"                  \"11\"\n\"weight\"                \"0\"\n\"antialias\"             \"1\"\n\"outline\"               \"1\"\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Should look like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Step 3.</p> <p>Now, while still inside the client scheme, scroll down to the very bottom.  You will find something that looks similar to this</p> <p></p> <p>You must add this exact code under the last font definition, and your font definition numbers should go in order, so for me, Seeker\u2019s Crosshair font will be <code>15</code>. The font name is also not a choice, it is what the author of the font signed it as, you can find out the exact name of any font by right-clicking the font, selecting Properties, selecting Details, and the <code>Title</code> of the font is the name.</p> <pre><code>\"15\"\n{\n\"font\" \"resource/crosshairs/TF2Crosshairs.ttf\"\n\"font\" \"resource/crosshairs/tf2crosshairs_linux.ttf\" [$LINUX]\n\"name\" \"TF2Crosshairs\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>See here:</p> <p></p> <p>The result should look something similar to this:</p> <p></p> <p>Remember to save your file!</p> <p>Step 4.</p> <p>Locate the <code>hudlayout.res</code> file by going to <code>harvardhud/scripts</code> and it will be in there. Most HUDs will have there crosshairs right in the front, as mine does as well. My HUD is a little bit more trickier than other HUDs as I have pre-animated, and pre-outlined HUD crosshairs to choose from. You can install the HUD Crosshair anywhere in the file, for the sake of the order of my crosshairs in my HUD, I\u2019m going to be doing it a certain way, you can put it at the very top if you would like.</p> <p>The file when you first open it should look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Now press CTRL+F and search for \u201cYZ50KonrWings\u201d as I will be installing the Seeker\u2019s Crosshair right underneath that, this is only for my HUD, and your HUD will most likely be different. Now insert this section of code into the file.</p> <p>It should look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>If you want to change the color of the crosshair, you have to edit the <code>fgcolor</code>, you can pick out the color by using this to help you select a color, note the first digit is the red value, second digit is green, third is blue, and the final digit is the alpha or transparency value, you should leave that at <code>255</code> unless you actually do want a transparent crosshair (which most do not). Now if the crosshair is not perfectly centered, you must mess with the <code>xpos</code>, <code>ypos</code>, and <code>wide</code>, and <code>tall</code> values. It can sometimes be a very painful process, though I am almost certain that the way the Seeker\u2019s Crosshair is now, it is perfectly centered, so do not mess with it unless you are positive it is not centered.</p> <p>Remember to save the file!</p> <p>Final Step.</p> <p>Now take the font file previously mentioned above and install it in the HUD. Most HUDs tend to have a dedicated <code>fonts</code> folder for their HUD, most HUDs including my own will have it be in <code>harvardhud/resource/fonts</code> and you just drop the file into there. Note, the file path of the installed font in the client scheme must match.</p> <p>See here:</p> <p></p> <p>See how the file path is the same. The end result of the font folder should look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Now enabling the font is by far the easiest part.</p> <p>All you do is go into the <code>hudlayout.res</code> file in <code>harvardhud/scripts</code>, and find the HUD crosshair you want to use, and make the <code>enabled</code> and <code>visible</code> value both <code>1</code>, although most HUDs including my own have all crosshairs enabled, but not visible, so you will most likely only have to change the value of <code>visible</code>.</p> <p>Enabling Seeker\u2019s Crosshair will look like this:</p> <p></p> <p>And of course, do not forget to save the file!</p> <p>Sorry for the long wall of text and the messy guide, but hopefully it will get the job done.</p>"},{"location":"es/tf2/huds/hud_animations/","title":"Using the HUD Animations Manifest","text":"<p>Originally posted by omnibombulator on huds.tf</p> <p>Having a <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file in your custom HUD has proved somewhat of a hassle in TF2 updates. It\u2019s the primary cause of most in-game crashes and bugs. Even an update that doesn\u2019t change much in the way of actual HUD elements could cause a problem if the <code>hudanimations_tf</code> file is outdated.</p> <p>But there\u2019s a way to avoid this headache, so allow me to guide you through it.</p> <p><code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code>, the magic file When you extract the HUD from TF2 using GCFScape or this handy GitHub, you\u2019ll find the file <code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code> inside the <code>scripts</code> folder. This is the primary file we\u2019ll be using to get around avoiding HUD animation related crashes and having to update your <code>hudanimations_tf</code> file constantly to new updates.</p> <p>The file is extremely simple, including no more than 6 lines of code:</p> <pre><code>hudanimations_manifest\n{\n\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations.txt\"\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations_tf.txt\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p><code>hudanimations_manifest</code> is the file that tells the game what files to read animations from. So, it reads from the default Source <code>hudanimations.txt</code> file and the TF2 <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file. But we can add more files to this list. Our own files.</p> <p>First up, go to your scripts folder, open the <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file and copy any animations that have been modified in your HUD. Commonly modified animations are Health Animations (<code>HudHealthBonusPulse</code>, <code>HudHealthBonusPulseLoop</code>, <code>HudHealthBonusPulseStop</code>, <code>HudHealthDyingPulse</code>, <code>HudHealthDyingPulseLoop</code>, <code>HudHealthDyingPulseStop</code>), Ammo Animations (<code>HudLowAmmoPulse</code>, <code>HudLowAmmoPulseLoop</code>, <code>HudLowAmmoPulseStop</code>) and Medic Animations (<code>HudMedicCharged</code>, <code>HudMedicChargedLoop</code>, <code>HudMedicChargedStop</code>). Paste the modified code into a new text file. For the sake of example, save the file as hudanimations_custom.txt to the scripts folder. Now you have a custom animation file, brilliant!</p> <p>Next step is to delete (or rename if you\u2019re unsure of if you\u2019ve missed some modified code) the custom <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file. We won\u2019t need this anymore, the game can read the original file from the <code>.vpk</code> the game includes from now on. This means the game will keep the animations up to date every time the game has an update that changes them!</p> <p>Now it\u2019s time to go back to the <code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code> file. We need to add the <code>hudanimations_custom.txt</code> file we created to it, so the game can read the animations from it.</p> <p>Quite simply, just add an extra line above the <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file value (as exampled below), then save the file:</p> <pre><code>hudanimations_manifest\n{\n\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations.txt\"\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations_custom.txt\"\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations_tf.txt\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>You can add as many different animation files as you like, so you can keep your Health, Ammo and Medic animations in separate files if you like it tidy that way! However, you must make sure that when you add extra files to <code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code>, that you place them above <code>hudanimations_tf</code>, else they will not overwrite the default TF2 animation file.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve followed everything correctly, your custom animations should work, and the game will keep all future animations updated for you. Of course, if your custom animations get updated, you will have to manually update them, however, common animation modifications such as Health and Ammo are rarely updated.</p>"},{"location":"es/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/","title":"In-Depth HUD Crosshair Guide","text":"<p>Originally posted by omnibombulator on huds.tf</p> <p>This guide has been ported over from the old HUDS.TF Guides section.

It displays information relevant to the user while in-game, such as health, ammo, the scoreboard, and much more. It is controlled by text documents that determine positioning, size, visibility, color, and everything else about all of its moving bits and pieces. These documents, saved as <code>.res</code> files, can be edited by the user to change existing bits and pieces, which will henceforth referred to as controls, or, more interestingly, at least for our purposes, add new controls. One technique users have been using since as early as 2009 is to place a control into their HUDs to serve as a crosshair. That is, something that will tell them where the center of their screen is.

It might be a bit buggy or pixelated, however, so, same as your crosshair, test out enabling and disabling it for optimum results.</p> <p>Back to resizing. Something a lot of HUD makers do to make things easier is to create many definitions for the same font. This is because the only way to change the size of a font is to change the font definition. So, an easy shortcut is to name each definition according to the size it is. For example, make one called <code>crosshair12</code>, with the <code>tall</code> value being <code>12</code>, another named <code>crosshair14</code> with the <code>tall</code> value of <code>14</code>, all the way up to <code>54</code>, which is the highest tall value that TF2 accepts. This is useful because TF2 doesn\u2019t reload <code>ClientScheme.res</code> (or the main menu, for that matter, if you\u2019re interested) when you type <code>hud_reloadscheme</code> in console, so you need to restart the game each time you change <code>ClientScheme.res</code>.

I elaborate on how exactly to change <code>fgcolor</code> below under Specific Parameters. For image crosshairs, it is significantly more difficult: you need to actually edit the <code>.vtf</code> file itself and change the color in an image editor.

The third possibility is only relevant if it\u2019s a text crosshair and you\u2019re using macOS or Linux; sometimes fonts get cut off in TF2 on macOS/Linux: this is due to differences in how Windows handles fonts compared to these operating systems, and therefore how TF2 expects its fonts to be handled.

Now, for the up or down: <code>North</code> for up, <code>South</code> for down. Another, simpler way to explain is that this property uses the cardinal directions for values, as well as <code>Left</code> and <code>Right</code>. To enter more than one alignment you must use the cardinal directions with the vertical alignment first, for example <code>North-West</code> for top left alignment. Basically, think of the text as being inside of a box. The box is what the control creates, more accurately what the control actually is, and you define the wide and tall values for it. <code>Center</code> would make the text aligned to the center of the box. <code>West</code> would put it on the left side of the box. <code>East</code> would put it on the right side of the box.

You are going to want your dimensions to be a square power of 2.          I usually use 1024 by 1024 or 512 by 512, a square file is easier to center regardless of crosshair shape so I\u2019d advise making it square.</p> </li> <li> <p>Before you hit \u201cOK\u201d go to the arrow near \u201cAdvanced Options\u201d, click it, then go to \u201cFill With\u201d and select \u201cTransparency\u201d from the drop-down menu.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now you have your canvas on which to create your crosshair.</p> </li> <li> <p>The very basics are this: create a selection and fill it with a color. To this end, some useful tools are the selection tools, rectangle, ellipse, free select, etc.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Here are some tips and tricks to using these tools:</p> <ul> <li> <p>First off, whenever you are using a tool it\u2019s a good idea to have the \u201cTool Options\u201d window open. If you don\u2019t see it go up to Windows &gt; Dockable Dialogs &gt; Tool Options. This is extremely useful.</p> </li> <li> <p>For making a circle be uniform/perfect you can simply set aspect ratio to be 1:1 or change the dimensions manually in the same (Tool Options) window. Obviously the same can be used to mess with a rectangular selection/make it square.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you are copying and pasting/editing a pre-existing crosshair an extremely useful tool is the \u201cSelect By Color\u201d tool. It selects all pixels in the image of the color that you click on.</p> </li> <li> <p>For any of these selection tools it\u2019s useful to be able to subtract or add to it easily, so take note of the buttons at the top of the \u201cTool Options\u201d window: they change the mode of selection you are currently in, from making a new selection to adding/subtracting/intersecting with the current one. For example, to make a ring you make a circle then change the mode to subtract from selection and put a smaller circle inside. There are an abundance of GIMP tutorials on the subject, and a video does it much better than I can. Another example is that maybe selecting by color didn\u2019t get everything you hoped it would. Change to \u201cAdd to Selection\u201d and you can easily add different shades of the same color which you want to include that weren\u2019t picked up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Another useful trick for selecting by color is that if there is an image and you want to effectively get rid of a inform background you can select the background then hit Edit&gt;Clear to send it to transparent or Select &gt; Invert to invert the selection, effectively selecting every pixel in the image that is NOT the color you selected. The invert selection button is immensely useful in multiple other ways as well.</p> </li> <li> <p>One more useful tool is \u201cAlign\u201d to align your selection or layer to the center of the image for the easiest time making a multiple layered image look neat. For example, to make the backgrounds to the health cross I used in my HUD.   I made a circle selection, went to tool options, changed the size to 300 x 300, went to align tool, center aligned it, then filled the whole thing with blue or black or whichever. Then I made a rectangular selection, made it 75 x 200 ( I think, don\u2019t quite remember), centered it with the align tool. Then I went to edit&gt;clear to send that rectangle in the middle to transparent. Then I made another rectangular selection, 200 x 75 this time, and center aligned it, then \u201ccleared\u201d that one as well. The result satisfies my perfectionistic (is this a word?) OCD tendencies.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"es/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/#export","title":"Export","text":"<p>From here you can either use the VTF Photoshop/Paint.NET plugin or the GIMP VTF plugin to export to a <code>.vtf</code> file.

If you wish to do it by hand, simply make a new text document and paste this in:</p> <pre><code>\"UnlitGeneric\"\n{\n\"$translucent\" 1\n\"$basetexture\" \"vgui\\replay\\thumbnails\\&lt;your file name&gt;\"\n\"$yertexcolor\" 1\n\"$no_fullbright\" 1\n\"$ignorez\" 1\n}\n</code></pre> <p>For more advanced users: there are many interesting things that can be done with VMTs, such as making everything beneath it transparent, or making it spin or change color when you are moving. More info on that can be found here. To note: I couldn\u2019t personally get the proxy <code>PlayerDamageTime</code> to work at all, which is disappointing because if it had worked one could create a material in their HUD that would change color or become visible only when the player had crit-heals. I personally was going to make an outline for the health cross, or a bar under the health, although something near the crosshair would be cool too. JarateKing, who knows much more about material proxies than I do, likewise failed, so that particular proxy might not work in TF2, unfortunately.</p> <p>Here is an example <code>.vmt</code> where the crosshair would rotate, pulse blue, and flash green when you are moving:</p> <pre><code>\"UnlitGeneric\"\n{\n\"$translucent\" \"1\"\n\"$basetexture\" \"vgui\\replay\\thumbnails\\crosshair_kent_010\"\n\n\"$angle\" \"0.0\"\n\"$translate\" \"[0.0 0.0]\"\n\"$center\" \"[0.5 0.5]\"\n\n\"$color\" \"[0.0 0.0 0.0]\"\n\"$speed\" \"0\"\n\n\"$vertexcolor\" \"1\"\n\"$no_fullbright\" \"1\"\n\"$vertexalpha\" \"1\"\n\"$ignorez\" \"1\"\n\n\"Proxies\"\n{\n// Rotates the crosshair\n\"LinearRamp\"\n{\n\"rate\" \"600\" // Adjust this, higher spins faster\n\"initialValue\" \"0.0\"\n\"resultVar\" \"$angle\"\n}\n\"TextureTransform\"\n{\n\"translateVar\" \"$translate\"\n\"rotateVar\" \"$angle\"\n\"centerVar\" \"$center\"\n\"resultVar\" \"$basetexturetransform\"\n}\n\n// Makes the crosshair pulse blue\n\"Sine\"\n{\n\"sinemin\" \"0.3\"\n\"minemax\" \"0.5\"\n\"sineperiod\" \"1\"\n\"resultVar\" \"$color[2]\"\n}\n\n// Makes the crosshair light up green when the player is moving\n\"PlayerSpeed\"\n{\n\"resultVar\" \"$speed\"\n}\n\"Clamp\"\n{\n\"min\" \"0.5\"\n\"max\" \"1.0\"\n\"srcVar1\" \"$speed\"\n\"resultVar\" \"$color[1]\"\n}\n\n// Enable animation in the crosshair, set framerate\n//\"AnimatedTexture\"\n//{\n// \"animatedtexturevar\" \"$basetexture\"\n// \"animatedtextureframenumvar\" \"$frame\"\n// \"animatedtextureframerate\" \"30\"\n//}\n}\n\n}\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>More info on this specific crosshair found in this YouTube video.</p> <p>Another example:</p> <p></p> <p>More info on this specific <code>.vmt</code> including a download link can be found here.</p> <p>Here is an example <code>.vmt</code> where it would mask everything beneath it and make it transparent, which can be used to make anything in your HUD partially transparent, even your viewmodels.</p> <pre><code>\"Refract\"\n{\n\"%keywords\" \"tf\"\n\"$refractamount\" \"0.0\"\n\"$refracttint\" \"{255 255 255}\"\n\"$refractblur\" \"0.0\"\n\n\"$scale\" \"[1 1]\"\n\"$normalmap\" \"vgui/replay/thumbnails/REFRACTnormal\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Here is more information on transparent viewmodels with this method.</p> <p>The path to create your own text crosshair is one I confess I personally have never done. I do, however, understand the basic concept. What you will need to do is to create a vector image of the crosshair that you want to use, the application to use for that is probably Adobe Illustrator, a free application I have used is Inkscape, which is compatible with GIMP. I wouldn\u2019t highly recommend Inkscape but you can easily Google alternatives yourself. Then get your hands on a font editor, FontForge probably being the best, although there are many other alternatives. Import your vector image into your custom font and save it as a <code>.ttf</code> or <code>.otf</code> and vo\u00edla. Google will need to be your friend on this one as I cannot help you much, sorry.</p>"},{"location":"es/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/#toggling","title":"Toggling","text":"<p>Toggling your HUD crosshair means turning it on or off at will.

On the other hand, <code>TextExample</code>, the text crosshair, would only be visible when minmode is off, or, when <code>cl_hud_minmode</code> is set to <code>0</code>. In this way you can use a console command to turn your crosshair on or off as you please. However, this is the method that I referenced earlier as being by class, meaning I recommend putting the command in your class configs to turn the crosshair on or off based on which class you are. The reason is that toggling this command causes in-game stutter, which makes sense: after all, the command is essentially telling the game to reload every single HUD file, similar to a <code>hud_reloadscheme</code>.</p>"},{"location":"es/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/#achievement-tracker","title":"Achievement Tracker","text":"<p>This method is a bit more complicated, but the concept remains simple.

Basically: Valve added a feature to use, instead of the default class image, a dynamic and 3D player model complete with accurate weapons, hats, and running/swimming postures. Due to performance issues, Valve added a console command to toggle the feature on or off. By replacing the background that accompanies, by default, this feature, with our own image crosshair, we can then toggle the crosshair on or off at will. I would recommend only using this method if you can live without the 3D model. If you do wish to use it, all that is necessary to do this is to replace the following control in <code>HudPlayerClass.res</code> with your crosshair.</p> <p></p> <p>So, using my previous example image crosshair, it would look something like this:</p> <pre><code>\"classmodelpanelBG\"\n{\n\"ControlName\" \"CTFImagePanel\"\n\"fieldName\" \"classmodelpanelBG\"\n\"visible\" \"0\"\n\"enabled\" \"1\"\n\"visible_minmode\" \"0\"\n\"enabled_minmode\" \"1\"\n\"xpos\" \"c0\"\n\"ypos\" \"c0\"\n\"zpos\" \"0\"\n\"wide\" \"100\"\n\"tall\" \"100\"\n\"alpha\" \"255\"\n\"image\" \"replay/thumbnails/*your file name*\"\n\"scaleimage\" \"1\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The only thing to be careful about is that you have <code>visible</code> set to <code>0</code> and <code>enabled</code> set to <code>1</code>. As explained under their respective sections under Basic Parameters, this ensures that you can actually turn it off or on. If <code>enabled</code> and <code>visible</code> are both set to <code>0</code> your crosshair will never show up because it will never be loaded by the HUD. If both are set to <code>1</code> then the crosshair will always be visible and you won\u2019t be able to truly \u201ctoggle\u201d it on and off.</p> <p>Another thing you may want to do is scroll down a little bit in <code>HudPlayerClass.res</code> and change <code>xpos</code> to <code>9999</code> under <code>\"classmodelpanel\"</code>.

You edit things by overriding things in your user overrides \u201clayer\u201d. Your user layer consists of a user modules layer, autoexec layer, game overrides layer, and class config layer. Modules override mastercomfig/preset modules layer. Autoexec layer overrides mastercomfig/addons layer. Game overrides layer overrides mastercomfig game overrides (run on game join/every time you change class), and per-class networking settings, for all classes. Class config layer overrides mastercomfig game overrides (class configs run after game overrides) and per-class networking settings, for a single class.</p> <p>This layered approach means that the config\u2019s settings are more managed (that is most things are done for you, with you changing a few things based on your own preference, so that settings don\u2019t conflict for best possible stability and performance), and contained (you can easily drop in a new version of mastercomfig, and your layers will remain in your overrides folder, so you don\u2019t have to re-edit anything whenever you change a version). See the next few questions for more details.</p> <p>With this approach, you\u2019ll find yourself reading documentation more rather than digging through config files, checking to see how you can do something or change a setting when you encounter something you\u2019d like changed. However, the GitHub source is a good reference for some things. For example, you can see the many comments within the main comfig.cfg for information about settings within mastercomfig, as well as how to override individual things at a finer level than with modules. But be careful about compatibility conflicts between different console variables in this case! You can see what modules are used in your preset so you only override modules that you need.</p>"},{"location":"fr/faq/#why-does-mastercomfig-use-a-vpk","title":"Why does mastercomfig use a VPK?","text":"<p>mastercomfig is not just a configuration file like older FPS configs which only use autoexec.cfg. It is a complete performance and customization scripting mod which requires many custom files to work.</p> <p>Here are some of the features that mastercomfig gains, by being a mod rather a configuration file:</p> <ul> <li> <p>dxsupport overrides, which unlocks <code>r_drawropes</code>, <code>fx_drawimpactdebris</code>, <code>fx_drawimpactdust</code>, <code>fx_drawimpactspark</code>, <code>tf_impactwatertimeenable</code>, <code>dsp_off</code>, <code>cl_particle_retire_cost</code> and <code>mat_slopescaledepthbias_decal</code></p> </li> <li> <p>These allow for performance improvements for ropes, particles, sound, and fixing a bug where 1 decal still appears even if decals are disabled</p> </li> <li> <p>Class spawn scripts, which allow for scripts to be run periodically during a match</p> </li> <li> <p>Modular design which allows for an extensive user overrides system (modules, addons, configs), rather than having to redo edits every time mastercomfig updates and not know what edits you made from the base config</p> </li> <li> <p><code>mm_override</code> script, which fixes crashes while loading for Competitive matchmaking</p> </li> <li> <p>Optimized preload configuration, which improves memory usage and load times</p> </li> <li> <p>No messy cloud sync or config saving propagation which happens in the <code>cfg</code> folder</p> </li> </ul> <p>Now, this only explains why mastercomfig is a mod, which can also be a folder, rather than explaining why mastercomfig is a VPK.</p> <p>mastercomfig is specifically a VPK because:</p> <ul> <li>Encourages people to use the modular customization system in mastercomfig, which does not require manual intervention every update to redo custom settings</li> <li>Easy distribution, and drag and drop into the custom folder, and recommended by Valve:</li> </ul> <p>Quote</p> <p>First, mount all user customizations. This will search for VPKs and subfolders and mount them in alphabetical order. The easiest way to distribute a mod is to pack up the custom content into a VPK. To \u201cinstall\u201d a mod, just drop it in this folder.</p> <p>Source</p> <ul> <li>Better performance, as stated by Valve:</li> </ul> <p>Quote</p> <p>When the game boots, this folder is automatically scanned for VPK files or subfolders. Each subfolder or VPK is added as a search path, so the files inside those VPK\u2019s or subfolders will override the default game files. Mounting a VPK to the filesystem is more efficient than adding a subfolder, as each time the engine needs to open a file, it will need to make a call to the operating system to search the folder. VPKs can therefore be searched by the engine much more efficiently. Each subfolder is a new search path that must be checked each time the engine tries to open a file. So, for optimal load times, always use VPK files and don\u2019t make any subfolders in this folder!</p> <p>Source</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>We search VPK files before ordinary folders, because most files will be found in VPK and we can avoid making thousands of file system calls to attempt to open files in folders where they don\u2019t exist.

If you add \u201c+cpu_frequency_monitoring 2\u201d to your launch options then the CPU\u2019s speed will be measured every two seconds. The measured frequency is compared to how fast Windows says that the CPU is running and this percentage is displayed in the <code>cl_showfps</code> and <code>net_graph</code> displays. Under normal circumstances this percentage should be 90% or higher. If the displayed CPU frequency percentage drops below about 80-85% then it suggests that your CPU may be overheating and being thermally throttled.

If these CPU slowdowns happen when your game is running slowly then it is reasonable to assume that they are the cause and that your CPU is overheating.

Interp is a low-level networking setting which controls how incoming packets are used by the client. Packets have an inherent delay, and may not come at all due to issues along your route, low server framerate, server framerate variance, and ping fluctuations. Interp is a very sensitive networking setting which tunes your buffer for incoming packets. If you set it too low, you will get networking errors, resulting in worse hitreg, because of trying to use game packets which have not come in yet.</p> <p>Imagine it like controlling the size of the gray bar in YouTube. If you set it too high, your video playback will be delayed. If you set it too low, then you will be constantly encountering freezing in video playback as the video download tries to keep up with playback. In the case of TF2, when the client needs to use a new server game packet when there is not one, it will instead extrapolate movement based on previous data, assuming that everything is continuing on its same path, which can be wildly inaccurate.</p> <p>If you are worried about the delay being high, rest assured that the tick delay caused by interpolation is compensated for the following: hitscan, melee, backstabs, flamethrower and the Medigun. Projectiles are simulated on the server, and thus are not compensated. Projectile spawns and despawns are not interpolated, which means that you may notice a client-side delay in projectiles exiting your barrel and subsequently impacting the target. In a game like TF2, this is not a huge issue, and you should be more worried about the accuracy of game state rather than a few milliseconds of client-side delay.</p> <p>Now having said all that, you still have the option to change interp if you really want to and understand what you\u2019re doing. The best way to change interp is to use the snapshot buffer module, which has a few preset values for the most common use case of higher than normal packet loss. If you want a specific interp value, the best place to set it is in <code>autoexec.cfg</code> (make sure it is in the <code>overrides</code> folder), like so:</p> <pre><code>cl_interp_ratio x\ncl_interp x\n</code></pre> <p>And then put this in <code>modules.cfg</code>:</p> <pre><code>snapshot_buffer=custom\n</code></pre> <p>One other thing to note is that client interp is determined by whichever is the greater of cl_interp_ratio divided by cl_updaterate, and the value of cl_interp. cl_interp_ratio and cl_interp have no interaction beyond that.</p>"},{"location":"fr/next_steps/quick_fixes/#scottish-resistance-stickybombs-have-no-outline","title":"Scottish Resistance stickybombs have no outline","text":"<p>Warning</p> <p>Outlines of any kind do not work on DirectX 8.</p> <p>On some mastercomfig presets, outlines are disabled.

I was interested to see if I could make a Custom Intro, and it turns out it\u2019s really easy.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Download The RAD Video Tools program. This program allows you to convert video and audio files to <code>.bik</code> format, which is the format that the opening Valve video is in.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open up RAD Video Tools and find your video of choice. Select the video and press the Bink it! button. (See below)</p> </li> </ol> <p> </p> <p>You can mess with the above settings to get higher quality video, but leaving the settings as the default garners you a decent result.</p> <p>You may find that while the program attempts to render, it will give you an Error when trying to open the file. I originally tried this using videos I had downloaded online, and the program did not like it. I eventually made a small HUDS.TF intro video using Sony Vegas, and saved it as a <code>.avi</code> file. This seemed to have done the trick, and you may get the result you want by putting your videos into a Video Editor first.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Once converted (shouldn\u2019t take long), watch the file back and make sure it\u2019s okay. Audio can be a bit of a pain (may not render), so you can mix audio in after by selecting the generated <code>.bik</code> file, then pressing the Mix in sound button. Just add your sound file of choice and the default settings should do the rest. Again, feel free to mess around with the settings if you want to get better results.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once you\u2019ve got the file you\u2019ve wanted, go into your Custom HUD folder. Create a media folder in the same directory your resource and scripts folders are (example below)</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Inside this folder, copy your <code>.bik</code> file into it, and create a file called startupvids.txt. Inside this file, you\u2019ll only need one line of text, which is <code>media/&lt;FILENAME&gt;.bik</code>, where <code>&lt;FILENAME&gt;</code> is, obviously, the name of your file. (examples below)</p> <p></p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Now open up Team Fortress 2 (make sure you do not have <code>-novid</code> in your launch options), and you\u2019ll see the result!</li> </ol> <p>Watch my example here:</p> <p>I\u2019ve also included an example file for you to use!</p> <p>Note</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to put this into a Custom HUD folder. You can make a separate Custom folder for your intro video to live in individually, so it will run on every Custom HUD you use, or even on the default TF2 HUD, similar to the way you would do a hitsound. <code>tf/custom/introvideo/media/</code> and then your files would work.</p>"},{"location":"fr/tf2/huds/font_crosshairs/","title":"Installing Font Crosshairs","text":"<p>Originally posted by HarvardBB on the huds.tf guide forums</p> <p>HUD Crosshairs are easy to install, but hard to make. For the simpleness of this thread, we will install pre-made crosshairs instead of making our own. Also a note, this installation is only for Windows, sorry Mac, and Linux users.</p> <p>For the sake of this tutorial we will be installing Seeker\u2019s Crosshair (Download, Linux Download) onto my HUD, HARVARDHUD.</p> <p>You Will Need</p> <ul> <li>A HUD</li> <li>Notepad++(Download)</li> <li>The crosshair font file of your choice</li> </ul> <p>Step 1.</p> <p>Locate your HUD files, you can do this easily by going to your Steam Library, right-clicking on Team Fortress 2, select Properties, select the \u201cLocal Files\u201d tab, select \u201cBrowse..\u201d, select the <code>tf</code> folder, select the <code>custom</code> folder, and inside should be your HUD folder.</p> <p>Step 2.</p> <p>First we need to install the font file into the HUD. First, locate the <code>clientscheme.res</code> file by going to <code>harvardhud/resource</code> and you will find it in there. Next, press CTRL+F and search for <code>ECON FONTS</code> and scroll down till you find a section called <code>HUD Fonts</code>, this name will differ from HUD to HUD, but my HUD has all of the HUD Fonts under <code>HUD Fonts</code>. You must then add this section of code into the client scheme here. This will give you the flexibility to have the crosshair with or without an underline, which ever you prefer.</p> <pre><code>\"seeker11\"\n{\n\"1\"\n{\n\"name\"                  \"TF2Crosshairs\"\n\"tall\"                  \"11\"\n\"weight\"                \"0\"\n\"antialias\"             \"1\"\n\"outline\"               \"1\"\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Should look like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Step 3.</p> <p>Now, while still inside the client scheme, scroll down to the very bottom.  You will find something that looks similar to this</p> <p></p> <p>You must add this exact code under the last font definition, and your font definition numbers should go in order, so for me, Seeker\u2019s Crosshair font will be <code>15</code>. The font name is also not a choice, it is what the author of the font signed it as, you can find out the exact name of any font by right-clicking the font, selecting Properties, selecting Details, and the <code>Title</code> of the font is the name.</p> <pre><code>\"15\"\n{\n\"font\" \"resource/crosshairs/TF2Crosshairs.ttf\"\n\"font\" \"resource/crosshairs/tf2crosshairs_linux.ttf\" [$LINUX]\n\"name\" \"TF2Crosshairs\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>See here:</p> <p></p> <p>The result should look something similar to this:</p> <p></p> <p>Remember to save your file!</p> <p>Step 4.</p> <p>Locate the <code>hudlayout.res</code> file by going to <code>harvardhud/scripts</code> and it will be in there. Most HUDs will have there crosshairs right in the front, as mine does as well. My HUD is a little bit more trickier than other HUDs as I have pre-animated, and pre-outlined HUD crosshairs to choose from. You can install the HUD Crosshair anywhere in the file, for the sake of the order of my crosshairs in my HUD, I\u2019m going to be doing it a certain way, you can put it at the very top if you would like.</p> <p>The file when you first open it should look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Now press CTRL+F and search for \u201cYZ50KonrWings\u201d as I will be installing the Seeker\u2019s Crosshair right underneath that, this is only for my HUD, and your HUD will most likely be different. Now insert this section of code into the file.</p> <p>It should look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>If you want to change the color of the crosshair, you have to edit the <code>fgcolor</code>, you can pick out the color by using this to help you select a color, note the first digit is the red value, second digit is green, third is blue, and the final digit is the alpha or transparency value, you should leave that at <code>255</code> unless you actually do want a transparent crosshair (which most do not). Now if the crosshair is not perfectly centered, you must mess with the <code>xpos</code>, <code>ypos</code>, and <code>wide</code>, and <code>tall</code> values. It can sometimes be a very painful process, though I am almost certain that the way the Seeker\u2019s Crosshair is now, it is perfectly centered, so do not mess with it unless you are positive it is not centered.</p> <p>Remember to save the file!</p> <p>Final Step.</p> <p>Now take the font file previously mentioned above and install it in the HUD. Most HUDs tend to have a dedicated <code>fonts</code> folder for their HUD, most HUDs including my own will have it be in <code>harvardhud/resource/fonts</code> and you just drop the file into there. Note, the file path of the installed font in the client scheme must match.</p> <p>See here:</p> <p></p> <p>See how the file path is the same. The end result of the font folder should look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Now enabling the font is by far the easiest part.</p> <p>All you do is go into the <code>hudlayout.res</code> file in <code>harvardhud/scripts</code>, and find the HUD crosshair you want to use, and make the <code>enabled</code> and <code>visible</code> value both <code>1</code>, although most HUDs including my own have all crosshairs enabled, but not visible, so you will most likely only have to change the value of <code>visible</code>.</p> <p>Enabling Seeker\u2019s Crosshair will look like this:</p> <p></p> <p>And of course, do not forget to save the file!</p> <p>Sorry for the long wall of text and the messy guide, but hopefully it will get the job done.</p>"},{"location":"fr/tf2/huds/hud_animations/","title":"Using the HUD Animations Manifest","text":"<p>Originally posted by omnibombulator on huds.tf</p> <p>Having a <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file in your custom HUD has proved somewhat of a hassle in TF2 updates. It\u2019s the primary cause of most in-game crashes and bugs. Even an update that doesn\u2019t change much in the way of actual HUD elements could cause a problem if the <code>hudanimations_tf</code> file is outdated.</p> <p>But there\u2019s a way to avoid this headache, so allow me to guide you through it.</p> <p><code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code>, the magic file When you extract the HUD from TF2 using GCFScape or this handy GitHub, you\u2019ll find the file <code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code> inside the <code>scripts</code> folder. This is the primary file we\u2019ll be using to get around avoiding HUD animation related crashes and having to update your <code>hudanimations_tf</code> file constantly to new updates.</p> <p>The file is extremely simple, including no more than 6 lines of code:</p> <pre><code>hudanimations_manifest\n{\n\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations.txt\"\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations_tf.txt\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p><code>hudanimations_manifest</code> is the file that tells the game what files to read animations from. So, it reads from the default Source <code>hudanimations.txt</code> file and the TF2 <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file. But we can add more files to this list. Our own files.</p> <p>First up, go to your scripts folder, open the <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file and copy any animations that have been modified in your HUD. Commonly modified animations are Health Animations (<code>HudHealthBonusPulse</code>, <code>HudHealthBonusPulseLoop</code>, <code>HudHealthBonusPulseStop</code>, <code>HudHealthDyingPulse</code>, <code>HudHealthDyingPulseLoop</code>, <code>HudHealthDyingPulseStop</code>), Ammo Animations (<code>HudLowAmmoPulse</code>, <code>HudLowAmmoPulseLoop</code>, <code>HudLowAmmoPulseStop</code>) and Medic Animations (<code>HudMedicCharged</code>, <code>HudMedicChargedLoop</code>, <code>HudMedicChargedStop</code>). Paste the modified code into a new text file. For the sake of example, save the file as hudanimations_custom.txt to the scripts folder. Now you have a custom animation file, brilliant!</p> <p>Next step is to delete (or rename if you\u2019re unsure of if you\u2019ve missed some modified code) the custom <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file. We won\u2019t need this anymore, the game can read the original file from the <code>.vpk</code> the game includes from now on. This means the game will keep the animations up to date every time the game has an update that changes them!</p> <p>Now it\u2019s time to go back to the <code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code> file. We need to add the <code>hudanimations_custom.txt</code> file we created to it, so the game can read the animations from it.</p> <p>Quite simply, just add an extra line above the <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file value (as exampled below), then save the file:</p> <pre><code>hudanimations_manifest\n{\n\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations.txt\"\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations_custom.txt\"\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations_tf.txt\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>You can add as many different animation files as you like, so you can keep your Health, Ammo and Medic animations in separate files if you like it tidy that way! However, you must make sure that when you add extra files to <code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code>, that you place them above <code>hudanimations_tf</code>, else they will not overwrite the default TF2 animation file.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve followed everything correctly, your custom animations should work, and the game will keep all future animations updated for you. Of course, if your custom animations get updated, you will have to manually update them, however, common animation modifications such as Health and Ammo are rarely updated.</p>"},{"location":"fr/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/","title":"In-Depth HUD Crosshair Guide","text":"<p>Originally posted by omnibombulator on huds.tf</p> <p>This guide has been ported over from the old HUDS.TF Guides section.

It displays information relevant to the user while in-game, such as health, ammo, the scoreboard, and much more. It is controlled by text documents that determine positioning, size, visibility, color, and everything else about all of its moving bits and pieces. These documents, saved as <code>.res</code> files, can be edited by the user to change existing bits and pieces, which will henceforth referred to as controls, or, more interestingly, at least for our purposes, add new controls. One technique users have been using since as early as 2009 is to place a control into their HUDs to serve as a crosshair. That is, something that will tell them where the center of their screen is.

Antialiasing is pretty different in fonts, and doesn\u2019t always work, so try enabling/disabling it yourself and see.</p> <p>In addition to antialiasing, you might want to change <code>\"outline\"</code> to <code>1</code>, which will put a black outline around your crosshair. It might be a bit buggy or pixelated, however, so, same as your crosshair, test out enabling and disabling it for optimum results.</p> <p>Back to resizing. Something a lot of HUD makers do to make things easier is to create many definitions for the same font. This is because the only way to change the size of a font is to change the font definition. So, an easy shortcut is to name each definition according to the size it is. For example, make one called <code>crosshair12</code>, with the <code>tall</code> value being <code>12</code>, another named <code>crosshair14</code> with the <code>tall</code> value of <code>14</code>, all the way up to <code>54</code>, which is the highest tall value that TF2 accepts. This is useful because TF2 doesn\u2019t reload <code>ClientScheme.res</code> (or the main menu, for that matter, if you\u2019re interested) when you type <code>hud_reloadscheme</code> in console, so you need to restart the game each time you change <code>ClientScheme.res</code>.

You are going to want your dimensions to be a square power of 2.          I usually use 1024 by 1024 or 512 by 512, a square file is easier to center regardless of crosshair shape so I\u2019d advise making it square.</p> </li> <li> <p>Before you hit \u201cOK\u201d go to the arrow near \u201cAdvanced Options\u201d, click it, then go to \u201cFill With\u201d and select \u201cTransparency\u201d from the drop-down menu.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now you have your canvas on which to create your crosshair.</p> </li> <li> <p>The very basics are this: create a selection and fill it with a color. To this end, some useful tools are the selection tools, rectangle, ellipse, free select, etc.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Here are some tips and tricks to using these tools:</p> <ul> <li> <p>First off, whenever you are using a tool it\u2019s a good idea to have the \u201cTool Options\u201d window open. If you don\u2019t see it go up to Windows &gt; Dockable Dialogs &gt; Tool Options. This is extremely useful.</p> </li> <li> <p>For making a circle be uniform/perfect you can simply set aspect ratio to be 1:1 or change the dimensions manually in the same (Tool Options) window. Obviously the same can be used to mess with a rectangular selection/make it square.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you are copying and pasting/editing a pre-existing crosshair an extremely useful tool is the \u201cSelect By Color\u201d tool. It selects all pixels in the image of the color that you click on.</p> </li> <li> <p>For any of these selection tools it\u2019s useful to be able to subtract or add to it easily, so take note of the buttons at the top of the \u201cTool Options\u201d window: they change the mode of selection you are currently in, from making a new selection to adding/subtracting/intersecting with the current one. For example, to make a ring you make a circle then change the mode to subtract from selection and put a smaller circle inside. There are an abundance of GIMP tutorials on the subject, and a video does it much better than I can. Another example is that maybe selecting by color didn\u2019t get everything you hoped it would. Change to \u201cAdd to Selection\u201d and you can easily add different shades of the same color which you want to include that weren\u2019t picked up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Another useful trick for selecting by color is that if there is an image and you want to effectively get rid of a inform background you can select the background then hit Edit&gt;Clear to send it to transparent or Select &gt; Invert to invert the selection, effectively selecting every pixel in the image that is NOT the color you selected. The invert selection button is immensely useful in multiple other ways as well.</p> </li> <li> <p>One more useful tool is \u201cAlign\u201d to align your selection or layer to the center of the image for the easiest time making a multiple layered image look neat. For example, to make the backgrounds to the health cross I used in my HUD.   I made a circle selection, went to tool options, changed the size to 300 x 300, went to align tool, center aligned it, then filled the whole thing with blue or black or whichever. Then I made a rectangular selection, made it 75 x 200 ( I think, don\u2019t quite remember), centered it with the align tool. Then I went to edit&gt;clear to send that rectangle in the middle to transparent. Then I made another rectangular selection, 200 x 75 this time, and center aligned it, then \u201ccleared\u201d that one as well. The result satisfies my perfectionistic (is this a word?) OCD tendencies.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"fr/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/#export","title":"Export","text":"<p>From here you can either use the VTF Photoshop/Paint.NET plugin or the GIMP VTF plugin to export to a <code>.vtf</code> file.

I wouldn\u2019t highly recommend Inkscape but you can easily Google alternatives yourself. Then get your hands on a font editor, FontForge probably being the best, although there are many other alternatives.

The reason is that toggling this command causes in-game stutter, which makes sense: after all, the command is essentially telling the game to reload every single HUD file, similar to a <code>hud_reloadscheme</code>.</p>"},{"location":"fr/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/#achievement-tracker","title":"Achievement Tracker","text":"<p>This method is a bit more complicated, but the concept remains simple. Basically, TF2 has the capacity to display information about your progress on an in-game achievement of your choice, and you can toggle this feature on or off with a console command. To use this with a crosshair all you need to do is edit the file that controls the panel that tracks an achievement.

Basically: Valve added a feature to use, instead of the default class image, a dynamic and 3D player model complete with accurate weapons, hats, and running/swimming postures. Due to performance issues, Valve added a console command to toggle the feature on or off. By replacing the background that accompanies, by default, this feature, with our own image crosshair, we can then toggle the crosshair on or off at will. I would recommend only using this method if you can live without the 3D model. If you do wish to use it, all that is necessary to do this is to replace the following control in <code>HudPlayerClass.res</code> with your crosshair.</p> <p></p> <p>So, using my previous example image crosshair, it would look something like this:</p> <pre><code>\"classmodelpanelBG\"\n{\n\"ControlName\" \"CTFImagePanel\"\n\"fieldName\" \"classmodelpanelBG\"\n\"visible\" \"0\"\n\"enabled\" \"1\"\n\"visible_minmode\" \"0\"\n\"enabled_minmode\" \"1\"\n\"xpos\" \"c0\"\n\"ypos\" \"c0\"\n\"zpos\" \"0\"\n\"wide\" \"100\"\n\"tall\" \"100\"\n\"alpha\" \"255\"\n\"image\" \"replay/thumbnails/*your file name*\"\n\"scaleimage\" \"1\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The only thing to be careful about is that you have <code>visible</code> set to <code>0</code> and <code>enabled</code> set to <code>1</code>. As explained under their respective sections under Basic Parameters, this ensures that you can actually turn it off or on. If <code>enabled</code> and <code>visible</code> are both set to <code>0</code> your crosshair will never show up because it will never be loaded by the HUD. If both are set to <code>1</code> then the crosshair will always be visible and you won\u2019t be able to truly \u201ctoggle\u201d it on and off.</p> <p>Another thing you may want to do is scroll down a little bit in <code>HudPlayerClass.res</code> and change <code>xpos</code> to <code>9999</code> under <code>\"classmodelpanel\"</code>. This will move the actual 3D model off the screen so it doesn\u2019t turn on and off too. This way only your crosshair will be visible.</p>"},{"location":"fr/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/#in-game-image-crosshair","title":"In-Game Image Crosshair","text":"<p>It turns out, by using the console, that you can actually reference one of your images that you\u2019ve saved to the directory <code>materials/vgui/replay/thumbnails</code> as an in-game crosshair. That is, it\u2019s possible to \u201ctrick\u201d the game into using your image instead of a default crosshair. This allows you to modify it using the Options window (or console commands) to control color and size. You cannot, however, switch between your new custom crosshair and other default ones.</p> <p>All you need to do to use this method if you so desire is to make sure the .vtf and the accompanying .vmt are correctly created and placed and then type in console the following:</p> <pre><code>cl_crosshair_file ../replay/thumbnails/&lt;crosshair name&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Make sure to replace <code>&lt;crosshair name&gt;</code> with the name of your file and double-check that you have set up the .vmt file correctly.

As soon as you\u2019ve done this you\u2019re good to join any server and your crosshair should remain, at which point you can change the color with console commands or a crosshair switching script.

You edit things by overriding things in your user overrides \u201clayer\u201d. Your user layer consists of a user modules layer, autoexec layer, game overrides layer, and class config layer. Modules override mastercomfig/preset modules layer. Autoexec layer overrides mastercomfig/addons layer. Game overrides layer overrides mastercomfig game overrides (run on game join/every time you change class), and per-class networking settings, for all classes. Class config layer overrides mastercomfig game overrides (class configs run after game overrides) and per-class networking settings, for a single class.</p> <p>This layered approach means that the config\u2019s settings are more managed (that is most things are done for you, with you changing a few things based on your own preference, so that settings don\u2019t conflict for best possible stability and performance), and contained (you can easily drop in a new version of mastercomfig, and your layers will remain in your overrides folder, so you don\u2019t have to re-edit anything whenever you change a version). See the next few questions for more details.</p> <p>With this approach, you\u2019ll find yourself reading documentation more rather than digging through config files, checking to see how you can do something or change a setting when you encounter something you\u2019d like changed. However, the GitHub source is a good reference for some things. For example, you can see the many comments within the main comfig.cfg for information about settings within mastercomfig, as well as how to override individual things at a finer level than with modules. But be careful about compatibility conflicts between different console variables in this case! You can see what modules are used in your preset so you only override modules that you need.</p>"},{"location":"tr/faq/#why-does-mastercomfig-use-a-vpk","title":"Why does mastercomfig use a VPK?","text":"<p>mastercomfig is not just a configuration file like older FPS configs which only use autoexec.cfg. It is a complete performance and customization scripting mod which requires many custom files to work.</p> <p>Here are some of the features that mastercomfig gains, by being a mod rather a configuration file:</p> <ul> <li> <p>dxsupport overrides, which unlocks <code>r_drawropes</code>, <code>fx_drawimpactdebris</code>, <code>fx_drawimpactdust</code>, <code>fx_drawimpactspark</code>, <code>tf_impactwatertimeenable</code>, <code>dsp_off</code>, <code>cl_particle_retire_cost</code> and <code>mat_slopescaledepthbias_decal</code></p> </li> <li> <p>These allow for performance improvements for ropes, particles, sound, and fixing a bug where 1 decal still appears even if decals are disabled</p> </li> <li> <p>Class spawn scripts, which allow for scripts to be run periodically during a match</p> </li> <li> <p>Modular design which allows for an extensive user overrides system (modules, addons, configs), rather than having to redo edits every time mastercomfig updates and not know what edits you made from the base config</p> </li> <li> <p><code>mm_override</code> script, which fixes crashes while loading for Competitive matchmaking</p> </li> <li> <p>Optimized preload configuration, which improves memory usage and load times</p> </li> <li> <p>No messy cloud sync or config saving propagation which happens in the <code>cfg</code> folder</p> </li> </ul> <p>Now, this only explains why mastercomfig is a mod, which can also be a folder, rather than explaining why mastercomfig is a VPK.</p> <p>mastercomfig is specifically a VPK because:</p> <ul> <li>Encourages people to use the modular customization system in mastercomfig, which does not require manual intervention every update to redo custom settings</li> <li>Easy distribution, and drag and drop into the custom folder, and recommended by Valve:</li> </ul> <p>Quote</p> <p>First, mount all user customizations. This will search for VPKs and subfolders and mount them in alphabetical order. The easiest way to distribute a mod is to pack up the custom content into a VPK. To \u201cinstall\u201d a mod, just drop it in this folder.</p> <p>Source</p> <ul> <li>Better performance, as stated by Valve:</li> </ul> <p>Quote</p> <p>When the game boots, this folder is automatically scanned for VPK files or subfolders. Each subfolder or VPK is added as a search path, so the files inside those VPK\u2019s or subfolders will override the default game files. Mounting a VPK to the filesystem is more efficient than adding a subfolder, as each time the engine needs to open a file, it will need to make a call to the operating system to search the folder. VPKs can therefore be searched by the engine much more efficiently. Each subfolder is a new search path that must be checked each time the engine tries to open a file. So, for optimal load times, always use VPK files and don\u2019t make any subfolders in this folder!</p> <p>Source</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>We search VPK files before ordinary folders, because most files will be found in VPK and we can avoid making thousands of file system calls to attempt to open files in folders where they don\u2019t exist.

If the displayed CPU frequency percentage drops below about 80-85% then it suggests that your CPU may be overheating and being thermally throttled.

Interp is a low-level networking setting which controls how incoming packets are used by the client. Packets have an inherent delay, and may not come at all due to issues along your route, low server framerate, server framerate variance, and ping fluctuations. Interp is a very sensitive networking setting which tunes your buffer for incoming packets. If you set it too low, you will get networking errors, resulting in worse hitreg, because of trying to use game packets which have not come in yet.</p> <p>Imagine it like controlling the size of the gray bar in YouTube. If you set it too high, your video playback will be delayed. If you set it too low, then you will be constantly encountering freezing in video playback as the video download tries to keep up with playback. In the case of TF2, when the client needs to use a new server game packet when there is not one, it will instead extrapolate movement based on previous data, assuming that everything is continuing on its same path, which can be wildly inaccurate.</p> <p>If you are worried about the delay being high, rest assured that the tick delay caused by interpolation is compensated for the following: hitscan, melee, backstabs, flamethrower and the Medigun. Projectiles are simulated on the server, and thus are not compensated. Projectile spawns and despawns are not interpolated, which means that you may notice a client-side delay in projectiles exiting your barrel and subsequently impacting the target. In a game like TF2, this is not a huge issue, and you should be more worried about the accuracy of game state rather than a few milliseconds of client-side delay.</p> <p>Now having said all that, you still have the option to change interp if you really want to and understand what you\u2019re doing. The best way to change interp is to use the snapshot buffer module, which has a few preset values for the most common use case of higher than normal packet loss. If you want a specific interp value, the best place to set it is in <code>autoexec.cfg</code> (make sure it is in the <code>overrides</code> folder), like so:</p> <pre><code>cl_interp_ratio x\ncl_interp x\n</code></pre> <p>And then put this in <code>modules.cfg</code>:</p> <pre><code>snapshot_buffer=custom\n</code></pre> <p>One other thing to note is that client interp is determined by whichever is the greater of cl_interp_ratio divided by cl_updaterate, and the value of cl_interp. cl_interp_ratio and cl_interp have no interaction beyond that.</p>"},{"location":"tr/next_steps/quick_fixes/#scottish-resistance-stickybombs-have-no-outline","title":"Scottish Resistance stickybombs have no outline","text":"<p>Warning</p> <p>Outlines of any kind do not work on DirectX 8.</p> <p>On some mastercomfig presets, outlines are disabled.

I was interested to see if I could make a Custom Intro, and it turns out it\u2019s really easy.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Download The RAD Video Tools program. This program allows you to convert video and audio files to <code>.bik</code> format, which is the format that the opening Valve video is in.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open up RAD Video Tools and find your video of choice. Select the video and press the Bink it! button. (See below)</p> </li> </ol> <p> </p> <p>You can mess with the above settings to get higher quality video, but leaving the settings as the default garners you a decent result.</p> <p>You may find that while the program attempts to render, it will give you an Error when trying to open the file. I originally tried this using videos I had downloaded online, and the program did not like it. I eventually made a small HUDS.TF intro video using Sony Vegas, and saved it as a <code>.avi</code> file. This seemed to have done the trick, and you may get the result you want by putting your videos into a Video Editor first.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Once converted (shouldn\u2019t take long), watch the file back and make sure it\u2019s okay. Audio can be a bit of a pain (may not render), so you can mix audio in after by selecting the generated <code>.bik</code> file, then pressing the Mix in sound button. Just add your sound file of choice and the default settings should do the rest. Again, feel free to mess around with the settings if you want to get better results.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once you\u2019ve got the file you\u2019ve wanted, go into your Custom HUD folder. Create a media folder in the same directory your resource and scripts folders are (example below)</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Inside this folder, copy your <code>.bik</code> file into it, and create a file called startupvids.txt. Inside this file, you\u2019ll only need one line of text, which is <code>media/&lt;FILENAME&gt;.bik</code>, where <code>&lt;FILENAME&gt;</code> is, obviously, the name of your file. (examples below)</p> <p></p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Now open up Team Fortress 2 (make sure you do not have <code>-novid</code> in your launch options), and you\u2019ll see the result!</li> </ol> <p>Watch my example here:</p> <p>I\u2019ve also included an example file for you to use!</p> <p>Note</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to put this into a Custom HUD folder. You can make a separate Custom folder for your intro video to live in individually, so it will run on every Custom HUD you use, or even on the default TF2 HUD, similar to the way you would do a hitsound. <code>tf/custom/introvideo/media/</code> and then your files would work.</p>"},{"location":"tr/tf2/huds/font_crosshairs/","title":"Installing Font Crosshairs","text":"<p>Originally posted by HarvardBB on the huds.tf guide forums</p> <p>HUD Crosshairs are easy to install, but hard to make. For the simpleness of this thread, we will install pre-made crosshairs instead of making our own. Also a note, this installation is only for Windows, sorry Mac, and Linux users.</p> <p>For the sake of this tutorial we will be installing Seeker\u2019s Crosshair (Download, Linux Download) onto my HUD, HARVARDHUD.</p> <p>You Will Need</p> <ul> <li>A HUD</li> <li>Notepad++(Download)</li> <li>The crosshair font file of your choice</li> </ul> <p>Step 1.</p> <p>Locate your HUD files, you can do this easily by going to your Steam Library, right-clicking on Team Fortress 2, select Properties, select the \u201cLocal Files\u201d tab, select \u201cBrowse..\u201d, select the <code>tf</code> folder, select the <code>custom</code> folder, and inside should be your HUD folder.</p> <p>Step 2.</p> <p>First we need to install the font file into the HUD. First, locate the <code>clientscheme.res</code> file by going to <code>harvardhud/resource</code> and you will find it in there. Next, press CTRL+F and search for <code>ECON FONTS</code> and scroll down till you find a section called <code>HUD Fonts</code>, this name will differ from HUD to HUD, but my HUD has all of the HUD Fonts under <code>HUD Fonts</code>. You must then add this section of code into the client scheme here. This will give you the flexibility to have the crosshair with or without an underline, which ever you prefer.</p> <pre><code>\"seeker11\"\n{\n\"1\"\n{\n\"name\"                  \"TF2Crosshairs\"\n\"tall\"                  \"11\"\n\"weight\"                \"0\"\n\"antialias\"             \"1\"\n\"outline\"               \"1\"\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Should look like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Step 3.</p> <p>Now, while still inside the client scheme, scroll down to the very bottom.  You will find something that looks similar to this</p> <p></p> <p>You must add this exact code under the last font definition, and your font definition numbers should go in order, so for me, Seeker\u2019s Crosshair font will be <code>15</code>. The font name is also not a choice, it is what the author of the font signed it as, you can find out the exact name of any font by right-clicking the font, selecting Properties, selecting Details, and the <code>Title</code> of the font is the name.</p> <pre><code>\"15\"\n{\n\"font\" \"resource/crosshairs/TF2Crosshairs.ttf\"\n\"font\" \"resource/crosshairs/tf2crosshairs_linux.ttf\" [$LINUX]\n\"name\" \"TF2Crosshairs\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>See here:</p> <p></p> <p>The result should look something similar to this:</p> <p></p> <p>Remember to save your file!</p> <p>Step 4.</p> <p>Locate the <code>hudlayout.res</code> file by going to <code>harvardhud/scripts</code> and it will be in there. Most HUDs will have there crosshairs right in the front, as mine does as well. My HUD is a little bit more trickier than other HUDs as I have pre-animated, and pre-outlined HUD crosshairs to choose from. You can install the HUD Crosshair anywhere in the file, for the sake of the order of my crosshairs in my HUD, I\u2019m going to be doing it a certain way, you can put it at the very top if you would like.</p> <p>The file when you first open it should look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Now press CTRL+F and search for \u201cYZ50KonrWings\u201d as I will be installing the Seeker\u2019s Crosshair right underneath that, this is only for my HUD, and your HUD will most likely be different. Now insert this section of code into the file.</p> <p>It should look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>If you want to change the color of the crosshair, you have to edit the <code>fgcolor</code>, you can pick out the color by using this to help you select a color, note the first digit is the red value, second digit is green, third is blue, and the final digit is the alpha or transparency value, you should leave that at <code>255</code> unless you actually do want a transparent crosshair (which most do not). Now if the crosshair is not perfectly centered, you must mess with the <code>xpos</code>, <code>ypos</code>, and <code>wide</code>, and <code>tall</code> values. It can sometimes be a very painful process, though I am almost certain that the way the Seeker\u2019s Crosshair is now, it is perfectly centered, so do not mess with it unless you are positive it is not centered.</p> <p>Remember to save the file!</p> <p>Final Step.</p> <p>Now take the font file previously mentioned above and install it in the HUD.

Even an update that doesn\u2019t change much in the way of actual HUD elements could cause a problem if the <code>hudanimations_tf</code> file is outdated.</p> <p>But there\u2019s a way to avoid this headache, so allow me to guide you through it.</p> <p><code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code>, the magic file When you extract the HUD from TF2 using GCFScape or this handy GitHub, you\u2019ll find the file <code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code> inside the <code>scripts</code> folder. This is the primary file we\u2019ll be using to get around avoiding HUD animation related crashes and having to update your <code>hudanimations_tf</code> file constantly to new updates.</p> <p>The file is extremely simple, including no more than 6 lines of code:</p> <pre><code>hudanimations_manifest\n{\n\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations.txt\"\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations_tf.txt\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p><code>hudanimations_manifest</code> is the file that tells the game what files to read animations from. So, it reads from the default Source <code>hudanimations.txt</code> file and the TF2 <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file. But we can add more files to this list. Our own files.</p> <p>First up, go to your scripts folder, open the <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file and copy any animations that have been modified in your HUD. Commonly modified animations are Health Animations (<code>HudHealthBonusPulse</code>, <code>HudHealthBonusPulseLoop</code>, <code>HudHealthBonusPulseStop</code>, <code>HudHealthDyingPulse</code>, <code>HudHealthDyingPulseLoop</code>, <code>HudHealthDyingPulseStop</code>), Ammo Animations (<code>HudLowAmmoPulse</code>, <code>HudLowAmmoPulseLoop</code>, <code>HudLowAmmoPulseStop</code>) and Medic Animations (<code>HudMedicCharged</code>, <code>HudMedicChargedLoop</code>, <code>HudMedicChargedStop</code>). Paste the modified code into a new text file. For the sake of example, save the file as hudanimations_custom.txt to the scripts folder. Now you have a custom animation file, brilliant!</p> <p>Next step is to delete (or rename if you\u2019re unsure of if you\u2019ve missed some modified code) the custom <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file. We won\u2019t need this anymore, the game can read the original file from the <code>.vpk</code> the game includes from now on. This means the game will keep the animations up to date every time the game has an update that changes them!</p> <p>Now it\u2019s time to go back to the <code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code> file. We need to add the <code>hudanimations_custom.txt</code> file we created to it, so the game can read the animations from it.</p> <p>Quite simply, just add an extra line above the <code>hudanimations_tf.txt</code> file value (as exampled below), then save the file:</p> <pre><code>hudanimations_manifest\n{\n\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations.txt\"\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations_custom.txt\"\n\"file\" \"scripts/hudanimations_tf.txt\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>You can add as many different animation files as you like, so you can keep your Health, Ammo and Medic animations in separate files if you like it tidy that way! However, you must make sure that when you add extra files to <code>hudanimations_manifest.txt</code>, that you place them above <code>hudanimations_tf</code>, else they will not overwrite the default TF2 animation file.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve followed everything correctly, your custom animations should work, and the game will keep all future animations updated for you. Of course, if your custom animations get updated, you will have to manually update them, however, common animation modifications such as Health and Ammo are rarely updated.</p>"},{"location":"tr/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/","title":"In-Depth HUD Crosshair Guide","text":"<p>Originally posted by omnibombulator on huds.tf</p> <p>This guide has been ported over from the old HUDS.TF Guides section.

It displays information relevant to the user while in-game, such as health, ammo, the scoreboard, and much more. It is controlled by text documents that determine positioning, size, visibility, color, and everything else about all of its moving bits and pieces. These documents, saved as <code>.res</code> files, can be edited by the user to change existing bits and pieces, which will henceforth referred to as controls, or, more interestingly, at least for our purposes, add new controls. One technique users have been using since as early as 2009 is to place a control into their HUDs to serve as a crosshair. That is, something that will tell them where the center of their screen is.

Something a lot of HUD makers do to make things easier is to create many definitions for the same font. This is because the only way to change the size of a font is to change the font definition. So, an easy shortcut is to name each definition according to the size it is. For example, make one called <code>crosshair12</code>, with the <code>tall</code> value being <code>12</code>, another named <code>crosshair14</code> with the <code>tall</code> value of <code>14</code>, all the way up to <code>54</code>, which is the highest tall value that TF2 accepts. This is useful because TF2 doesn\u2019t reload <code>ClientScheme.res</code> (or the main menu, for that matter, if you\u2019re interested) when you type <code>hud_reloadscheme</code> in console, so you need to restart the game each time you change <code>ClientScheme.res</code>.

I elaborate on how exactly to change <code>fgcolor</code> below under Specific Parameters. For image crosshairs, it is significantly more difficult: you need to actually edit the <code>.vtf</code> file itself and change the color in an image editor.

The third possibility is only relevant if it\u2019s a text crosshair and you\u2019re using macOS or Linux; sometimes fonts get cut off in TF2 on macOS/Linux: this is due to differences in how Windows handles fonts compared to these operating systems, and therefore how TF2 expects its fonts to be handled.

I usually use 1024 by 1024 or 512 by 512, a square file is easier to center regardless of crosshair shape so I\u2019d advise making it square.</p> </li> <li> <p>Before you hit \u201cOK\u201d go to the arrow near \u201cAdvanced Options\u201d, click it, then go to \u201cFill With\u201d and select \u201cTransparency\u201d from the drop-down menu.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now you have your canvas on which to create your crosshair.</p> </li> <li> <p>The very basics are this: create a selection and fill it with a color. To this end, some useful tools are the selection tools, rectangle, ellipse, free select, etc.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Here are some tips and tricks to using these tools:</p> <ul> <li> <p>First off, whenever you are using a tool it\u2019s a good idea to have the \u201cTool Options\u201d window open. If you don\u2019t see it go up to Windows &gt; Dockable Dialogs &gt; Tool Options. This is extremely useful.</p> </li> <li> <p>For making a circle be uniform/perfect you can simply set aspect ratio to be 1:1 or change the dimensions manually in the same (Tool Options) window. Obviously the same can be used to mess with a rectangular selection/make it square.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you are copying and pasting/editing a pre-existing crosshair an extremely useful tool is the \u201cSelect By Color\u201d tool. It selects all pixels in the image of the color that you click on.</p> </li> <li> <p>For any of these selection tools it\u2019s useful to be able to subtract or add to it easily, so take note of the buttons at the top of the \u201cTool Options\u201d window: they change the mode of selection you are currently in, from making a new selection to adding/subtracting/intersecting with the current one. For example, to make a ring you make a circle then change the mode to subtract from selection and put a smaller circle inside. There are an abundance of GIMP tutorials on the subject, and a video does it much better than I can. Another example is that maybe selecting by color didn\u2019t get everything you hoped it would. Change to \u201cAdd to Selection\u201d and you can easily add different shades of the same color which you want to include that weren\u2019t picked up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Another useful trick for selecting by color is that if there is an image and you want to effectively get rid of a inform background you can select the background then hit Edit&gt;Clear to send it to transparent or Select &gt; Invert to invert the selection, effectively selecting every pixel in the image that is NOT the color you selected. The invert selection button is immensely useful in multiple other ways as well.</p> </li> <li> <p>One more useful tool is \u201cAlign\u201d to align your selection or layer to the center of the image for the easiest time making a multiple layered image look neat. For example, to make the backgrounds to the health cross I used in my HUD.   I made a circle selection, went to tool options, changed the size to 300 x 300, went to align tool, center aligned it, then filled the whole thing with blue or black or whichever. Then I made a rectangular selection, made it 75 x 200 ( I think, don\u2019t quite remember), centered it with the align tool. Then I went to edit&gt;clear to send that rectangle in the middle to transparent. Then I made another rectangular selection, 200 x 75 this time, and center aligned it, then \u201ccleared\u201d that one as well. The result satisfies my perfectionistic (is this a word?) OCD tendencies.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"tr/tf2/huds/hud_crosshairs/#export","title":"Export","text":"<p>From here you can either use the VTF Photoshop/Paint.NET plugin or the GIMP VTF plugin to export to a <code>.vtf</code> file.

I personally was going to make an outline for the health cross, or a bar under the health, although something near the crosshair would be cool too.

I do, however, understand the basic concept. What you will need to do is to create a vector image of the crosshair that you want to use, the application to use for that is probably Adobe Illustrator, a free application I have used is Inkscape, which is compatible with GIMP. I wouldn\u2019t highly recommend Inkscape but you can easily Google alternatives yourself. Then get your hands on a font editor, FontForge probably being the best, although there are many other alternatives. Import your vector image into your custom font and save it as a <code>.ttf</code> or <code>.otf</code> and vo\u00edla.

In this way you can use a console command to turn your crosshair on or off as you please. However, this is the method that I referenced earlier as being by class, meaning I recommend putting the command in your class configs to turn the crosshair on or off based on which class you are.
