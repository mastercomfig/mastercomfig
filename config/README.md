# config folder
This folder contains the original files for the config, used for creating the `.vpk` files. You can read the files in these folders for reference but it is not recommended to use the `comfig/comfig.cfg` as an `autoexec` by copying and pasting text, as you will lose the many benefits from the extra script and data files in the config.
