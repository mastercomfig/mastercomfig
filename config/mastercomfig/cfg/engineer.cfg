// This is a bit of a hard one. Engineer does not necessarily need the more
// precise hitboxes, but they definitely help on a variety of hitscan playstyles
// for just that extra edge with hitscan accuracy. Sure, it can theoretically

// cases, you won't be hitting people with the utmost accuracy on it.
// Furthermore, Engineer relies on his melee to take out spies.
