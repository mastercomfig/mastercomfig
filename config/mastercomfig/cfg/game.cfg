// Typically modules are executed in run_modules.cfg. However bot_skill primarily uses cvars that have the "game" attribute.
// This means that those cvars will be reset to their default values upon joining a server. 
// Since I want the bot_skill module to actually keep its changes and only have it run serverside, game.cfg is a better place to run it in. (No game.cfg is not broken; It just only executes serverside and this is intentional.)
// By putting it in game.cfg instead of game_overrides.cfg, bot_skill won't spam the console in non-cheat servers.

// Runs the bot_skill module.
bot_skill

// Since game.cfg is now used by mastercomfig, I made an override alias for it.
