# Customization

You can use user override files to customize specific settings in mastercomfig.

These are `autoexec.cfg`, which runs at game launch, the 9 class configs
(`scout.cfg`, `soldier.cfg`, `pyro.cfg`, `demoman.cfg`, `heavyweapons.cfg`, `engineer.cfg`,
`medic.cfg`, `sniper.cfg`, and `spy.cfg`) which run on switching to a new class, and `listenserver.cfg`
which runs when first spawning in a local server.
All of these files go into a folder called `overrides` you create in `tf/cfg`.

If you don't have these files, you can download the [mastercomfig template](https://github.com/mastercomfig/mastercomfig/releases/latest/download/template.zip) and move the `overrides` folder to your `tf/cfg/` folder to customize the config.

If there's something you'd like to run for all of your class configs, you can add it to `tf/cfg/overrides/game_overrides.cfg`.

## Utility Commands

* `run_modules`: Applies modules. Useful for changing module levels in-game, and then applying them all at once.
* `apply_overrides`: Runs user modules, applies modules and then runs user autoexec. Useful for changing your user overrides in-game.
* `restore_preset`: Restores modules back to preset defaults, without using user overrides.
* `restore_config`: Runs all of mastercomfig and user overrides again, resetting changes made in-game.
* `version_comfig`: Outputs the version of mastercomfig currently being used.
* `switchconsole`: Command for toggling console and console output. This is able to reduce the performance impact of console logging when the console is not toggled on.

## Game Overrides

Some modules set something called game overrides, which apply settings that override map or in-game only settings that can't be applied at launch.

If you want to override this part of the module, you will have to use their game override alias in `tf/cfg/overrides/autoexec.cfg`. This is comprised of
a override alias, which is run during game overrides, and an override option, which actually contains the settings which is run by the override alias.

* `shadows`: Uses `shadowlod_override` to control the model quality shadows render with
    * `shadowlod_low`: Uses the lowest model quality to render shadows
    * `shadowlod_high`: Uses the highest model quality (at root LOD) to render shadows

* `water`: Uses `cheap_water_override` to control the low quality water fade distance
    * `cheap_water_full`: Always uses fully cheap water
    * `cheap_water_partial`: Always uses partially cheap water, uses fully cheap water at a short distance
    * `cheap_water_minimal`: Uses partially cheap water at a short distance, uses fully cheap water at a further distance
    * `cheap_water_never`: Never uses any kind of cheap water

* `props`: Uses `detail_props_override` to control grass/detail prop rendering and its render distance
    * `detail_props_none`: Disables detail props
    * `detail_props_medium`: Enables detail props, at a far distance, with no fade in
    * `detail_props_full`: Enables detail props, at a far distance, with a gentle fade in

As an example, if you are using a lower water module, but do not want to use cheap water, you can add `alias cheap_water_override cheap_water_never`.

## Network Aliases

These aliases are used by mastercomfig to apply network settings per class (as listed below) when using the `snapshot_buffer=automatic` module level.

You can run them manually in your class config if you play a subclass, like Demoknight (`net_hitscan`) or Huntsman (`net_projectiles`).

You can also re-alias them to use your own network settings.

* `net_projectiles`: Alias for network settings on projectile classes (Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Medic) (`snapshot_buffer_low`).
* `net_hitscan`: Alias for network settings on hitscan classes (Scout, Heavy, Engineer, Sniper) (`snapshot_buffer_safe`).
* `net_spy`: Alias for network settings on Spy (`snapshot_buffer_safe`).

## Changing your preset

mastercomfig supports selecting a preset after download. Add a file to your `overrides` folder called `pre_comfig.cfg`. In this file, put your desired preset as `preset=preset-name`. Preset names are:

* none
* ultra
* high
* medium-high
* medium
* medium-low
* low
* very-low

You can check the current selected preset by entering `preset_level` into console.

## Optional Aliases

!!! warning
    These steps are entirely optional and are only for advanced customization.

You can change the name of your `overrides/modules.cfg` using the `modules_c` alias.
This means your override preferences can have multiple different options, sort of like presets, but for your own preferences! Change these aliases
in-game and use the `apply_overrides` command to apply your new user overrides. This can be used for having different quality choices or game configurations for
different scenarios or mood.

You can change the name of your custom class configs using the `class_config_classname` alias.
For example, you can put `alias class_config_heavyweapons"exec overrides/myheavy.cfg"` in `tf/cfg/overrides/autoexec.cfg` if you want to use the file `tf/cfg/overrides/myheavy.cfg` for Heavy.

You can change the name of your custom game overrides config using the `game_overrides_c` alias.
For example, you can put `alias game_overrides_c"exec overrides/mygameoverrides.cfg"` in `overrides/autoexec.cfg` if you want to use the file `tf/cfg/overrides/mygameoverrides.cfg`.

You can also get creative and use the aforementioned aliases to change your class config on the fly using binds or the console.
For example, you could have different class configs for Scout in competitive and casual and then change your `class_config_scout` alias to run your preferred class config when you want.

If you want to run something only the first time you spawn and never run again while you keep the game open use the `game_overrides_once_c` alias.

## Advanced Customization

When diving deep into customization the core of mastercomfig, you may find it useful to run things directly before and after mastercomfig's `comfig.cfg`, which provides core functionality and aliases.

You can use `overrides/pre_comfig.cfg` to run things before `comfig.cfg`, and `overrides/setup_hook.cfg` to run things after `comfig.cfg`.

Examples of `overrides/pre_comfig.cfg` uses can be things like customizing your preset like detailed above, or turning on debugging options to monitor the launch process of mastercomfig itself (ex: `sv_cheats 1;mat_debugalttab 1`).

Uses of `overrides/setup_hook.cfg` are rarer, but still valid. With this, you can directly override all aliases defined in mastercomfig's core. This can be used for changing the default modules file, making your own modules or module levels, or customizing the built-in ones, and more!

## Optional User Config Template

!!! warning
    These steps are entirely optional and are only for advanced customization.

To get an idea about what to put in your `overrides/autoexec.cfg` and select options,
you can download the autoexec template from the [latest release](https://github.com/mastercomfig/mastercomfig/releases/latest).

This config is only for advanced, fine-tuned customization and is completely optional. Modules are recommended to be used for granular customization.

## Debug Commands

mastercomfig provides a set of handy debugging commands used during mastercomfig's development to analyze several aspects of the game.

### General

* `debug_output`: Enable developer only output (`debug_output_1`). Shows various warnings about potential issues, and outputs console to the corner of the screen.
* `debug_output_toggle`: Cycle through all 4 modes (including disabled) for developer only output. Different modes display different amounts of information.
* `debug_output_display`: Display console output in the corner of the screen without showing additional information.
* `debug_output_1`: Enable developer only output level 1.
* `debug_output_2`: Enable developer only output level 2, which displays more information.

### Gameplay Testing

* `debug_instant_respawn`: Turns on fully instant respawn.
* `debug_invulnerable`: Toggles buddha mode (health cannot go below 1).
* `debug_bots`: Fills the server with bots with AI.
* `debug_target`: Adds a target bot, which can be damaged infinitely.

### Rendering

* `debug_occlusion`: Turns on debugging of the occlusion system.
* `debug_pixelvis`: Turns on debugging of the pixel visibility system.
* `debug_fillrate`: Shows overdraw from repeated passes.
* `debug_matsys_reload`: Reloads material system.

### Sound

* `debug_sound_loads`: Dumps the current state of the sound memory pool, and enables debug output for sound loads.
* `debug_sound_dsp`: Enables debug output of DSP parameters of sounds, and enables visualization for automatic room DSP, if it is enabled.

### Network
* `debug_network_packets`: Enables spew of each network packet sent and received, including compression information if relevant.
* `debug_network_drops`: Enables debug output of outdated or duplicate packets.
* `debug_network_graph`: Enables the full networking graph, which displays information about packet volume, interp timings, and packet rates.
* `debug_network_pred`: Enables network prediction error logging.

### FPS

* `debug_fps`: Enables the basic networking graph, which is handy for seeing FPS. Note that the graph has a noticeable performance impact.
* `debug_fps_range`: Enables full FPS counter, which shows absolute FPS mins and maxes. You can re-run this command to reset the mins and maxes.

### Profiling

* `debug_vprof_spikes`: Logs spikes below 100FPS (can be adjusted with `alias debug_vprof_spike"vprof_dump_spikes 100"`) to `tf/vprof_spikes.log` (can be adjusted with `alias debug_vprof_log_spike"con_logfile vprof_spike.log"`).
* `debug_vprof_dump`: Logs profiling data to `tf/vprof.log` (can be adjusted with `alias debug_vprof_log"con_logfile vprof.log"`). Can be re-run to reset timings data.
* `debug_vprof_report`: Logs a longer set of inclusive profiling data to `tf/vprof.log` (can be adjusted with `alias debug_vprof_log"con_logfile vprof.log"`). Can be re-run to reset timings data.
* `debug_vprof_off`: Turns off profiling.
