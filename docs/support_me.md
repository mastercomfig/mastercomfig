# Support me

You can support mastercoms using [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/mastercoms/) or [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/mastercoms) with money, or you can gift items through [trade offers](https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=85845165&token=M9cQHh8N).

If you are not able to directly support me, I have a [Support-A-Creator](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/support-a-creator-faq) code: `mastercoms`,
which you can specify in
[Fortnite](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/support-a-creator-faq),
[Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/support-a-creator/)
and other games on the Epic Games Store.
In connection with Epic Gamesâ€™ Support-A-Creator Program, I may receive a commission from certain in-game purchases.

<!-- You can use Ko-fi to get [a config commission](https://ko-fi.com/mastercoms/commissions), where I personally tune a config exactly to your preferences and PC setup. I can also do this via a trade for 3 keys. There is also an addon where I can do advanced scripting at your request (6 keys if paying via trade). -->

<!-- Finally, you can buy early access to the config for a month through [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/mastercoms/shop). This will give you access to more frequent updates released throughout the month, rather than the monthly stable releases of the config. -->

You have my endless gratitude if you support me with money or gift items, and this support encourages me so much!

If you are not able to support me through the above methods, that's fine too! Your thank yous are always cherished and mean so much to me!
