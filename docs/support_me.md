# Support me

You can support mastercoms using [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/mastercoms/) or [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/mastercoms) with money, or gift items through [trade offers](https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=85845165&token=M9cQHh8N). There's also a $2.99 supporter subscription on the [Discord server](https://discord.com/servers/mastercomfig-389089828249010188).

You can also gift me using Steam Wallet Funds! [Add me as a friend on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/mastercoms/) (leave a comment about gifting!) Then, you can gift me a [Steam Digital Card](https://store.steampowered.com/digitalgiftcards/selectgiftcard) or gift me a [wishlisted game](https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/profiles/76561198046110893/#sort=price).

If you cannot directly support me, I have a [Support-A-Creator](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/support-a-creator-faq) code: `mastercoms`,
which you can set in
[Fortnite](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/support-a-creator-faq),
[Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/support-a-creator/),
and other games on the [Epic Games Store](https://store.epicgames.com/), as well as purchasing games and DLC on the store itself.
In connection with Epic Gamesâ€™ Support-A-Creator Program, I receive a commission from these purchases.

You can also support my other projects, like playing on my [8v8 Team Deathmatch map for Fortnite](https://www.fortnite.com/@mastercoms/7761-6157-7902). Island code: `7761-6157-7902`

Lastly, you can [give me a Steam Award](https://steamcommunity.com/id/mastercoms?award=17).

<!-- You can use Ko-fi to get [a config commission](https://ko-fi.com/mastercoms/commissions), where I personally tune a config exactly to your preferences and PC setup. I can also do this via a trade for 3 keys. There is also an addon where I can do advanced scripting at your request (6 keys if paying via trade). -->

<!-- Finally, you can buy early access to the config for a month through [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/mastercoms/shop). This will give you access to more frequent updates released throughout the month, rather than the monthly stable releases of the config. -->

You have my endless gratitude if you support me with money or gift items, and this support encourages me so much!

If you cannot support me through the above methods, that's fine too! Your thank yous are always cherished and mean so much to me!
