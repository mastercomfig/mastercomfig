# Linux

!!! info
    These instructions are only for Linux systems.

## Kernel

Try a desktop oriented kernel like [Xanmod](https://xanmod.org/).

## cpupower

Use either the `performance`, `schedutil` or `ondemand` governors when playing TF2 by using `cpupower frequency-set -g performance`, for example. You can see available governors for your CPU with `cpupower frequency-info`.

## GameMode

[GameMode](https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode) is a handy utility released by Feral Interactive, which will change the CPU Governor from the default CPU governor to `performance`. Recent updates allow it to change a games' "nice priority", which will give the game more resources to work with.

## irqbalance

Balance IRQ interrupts across multiple cores by installing the `irqbalance` package on your distro and enabling the `irqbalance` service. This package is installed on most debian-based OS's by default, like Ubuntu and Linux Mint.

## Ananicy

You can install `schedtool` and [Ananicy](https://github.com/Nefelim4ag/Ananicy) and enable the `ananicy` to get automatically applied ruled based process priority balancing to improve resources allocated to TF2.

## Networking optimization

See the [Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Sysctl#Improving_performance) for information about improving networking parameters for performance.

## Virtual memory optimization

See the [Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Sysctl#Virtual_memory) for information about improving virtual memory parameters.

## Native Libraries

The automatic Steam runtime host library pinning is not enough to use native libraries
on TF2 as the TF2 launcher script shades in some libraries.

Go to `TF2_FOLDER/bin` and delete `libSDL2-2.0.so.0`, and `libtcmalloc_minimal.so.4`.
Now, Team Fortress 2 will not be able to load these libraries. The system will have to
provide them, so make sure you have the 32-bit/multilib versions of `libtcmalloc` and `sdl2`.

It's unknown if you can be VAC banned for this, but it is modifying libraries, which should be
restricted by VAC. So, do it at your own risk. I am not responsible for any VAC bans you may receive.
