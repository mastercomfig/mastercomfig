# Benchmarks

Benchmarking is the process through which you can scientifically measure the impact of changes to your system.

A large amount of benchmark data is crucial to ensuring that mastercomfig works on a wide variety of systems.

Thus, it's highly appreciated to benchmark mastercomfig and any changes you make to it or your system, so we can better understand the impact of these.

## How to benchmark

1. Download [the benchmark file](https://mega.nz/#!f8tlhDhR!nYgghqybOK15ObUykEczewB3242XHb_bJ4JP0rv1q6k).
2. Move it to the `tf/` folder.
3. Launch the game.
4. Enter `block_game_override_once;timedemo benchmark_test`
5. Record your timedemo output from the console `X frames X seconds X fps (X ms/f) X fps variability`.
6. Repeat `timedemo benchmark_test` as many times as you like to decrease the effects of systemic variation.

## Benchmark data

mastercomfig provides a service for recording benchmark data so that we can improve the config together based on data.
