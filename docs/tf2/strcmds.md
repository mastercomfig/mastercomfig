# String commands

String commands, also known as strcmds or nonccmds, are strings forwarded over the network for processing, rather than being handled by the command system.

## Client string commands

This process occurs when a command is not found in the client, or when the `cmd` command is used to directly forward the command to the server. You can also run this for bots using `bot_command`.

There are a few types of client string commands:

* Engine client commands: these are special commands already registered on the client and server as console commands, but are handled through string forwarding. These are all listed in the cvarlist.
* Dispatch client commands: these are console commands only registered on the server (flagged as `GAMEDLL`), but are accepted to be run by the client. These are listed on the cvarlist as well.
* Client commands: these are all other commands, which are parsed manually by handlers through their string command and arguments. These are not listed on the cvarlist.

## Server string commands

This process occurs when the server wants the client to run a command which is flagged by `server_can_execute`.

You can use the `clientcmd` command or a `point_clientcommand` entity to send these commands.
