# How to install mastercomfig

1. [Download](https://mastercomfig.com/download) the mastercomfig VPK files of your choice.
2. Go to your Steam library and right click on Team Fortress 2.
3. Click Properties.
4. Click the Local Files tab.
5. Click Browse Local Files...
6. Navigate to the `tf/custom` folder.
7. Drag the VPK files into this folder.
8. Set these launch options: `-novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -nohltv -particles 1`. For more information, read the [launch options customization guide](../customization/launch_options.md).

## Custom configs
If you have any of the following files, you will have to do some extra steps to get them to work with mastercomfig:

```
autoexec.cfg
scout.cfg
soldier.cfg
pyro.cfg
demoman.cfg
heavyweapons.cfg
engineer.cfg
medic.cfg
sniper.cfg
spy.cfg
```

1. Create a `user` folder where these files are located (most likely `tf/cfg`).
2. Drag these files into the newly created `user` folder.

!!! tip
    Although not required, if you move any other files (for example, `binds.cfg`), you will have to update the `exec` command from `exec binds.cfg` to `exec user/binds.cfg`.
