# How to install mastercomfig

1. [Use the app to generate](https://mastercomfig.com/app) a mastercomfig package of your choosing.
2. Go to your Steam library and right-click on Team Fortress 2.
3. Click Properties...
4. Set these launch options: `-novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -nohltv -particles 1 -precachefontchars -noquicktime`. For more information, read the [launch options customization guide](../customization/launch_options.md).
5. Click the Installed Files tab.
6. Click Browse...
7. A `Team Fortress 2` folder is opened.
8. Extract the `tf` folder  in the mastercomfig.zip into this folder.

## Custom configs

If you have any of the following files, you must do some extra steps to get them to work with mastercomfig:

```txt
autoexec.cfg
listenserver.cfg
scout.cfg
soldier.cfg
pyro.cfg
demoman.cfg
heavyweapons.cfg
engineer.cfg
medic.cfg
sniper.cfg
spy.cfg
```

1. Create an `overrides` folder where these files are located (most likely `tf/cfg`).
2. Drag these files into the newly created `overrides` folder.

!!! tip
    Although not required, if you move any other files (for example, `binds.cfg`), you will have to update the `exec` command from `exec binds.cfg` to `exec overrides/binds.cfg`.
