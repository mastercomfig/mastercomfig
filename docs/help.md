    Please note that we can only provide support for mastercomfig. Any unsupported modifications or overrides of mastercomfig which do not use the VPK as downloaded from the official site, like using an extracted or packaged version of mastercomfig, modifying mastercomfig files directly, or merging mastercomfig with some other config like Comanglia, or Chris config will not be supported. Please make sure you clean up your installation before switching from an old config to mastercomfig. We also appreciate if you familiarize yourself with the abundant documentation available, for installation, quick fixes, modules and other customization features.
