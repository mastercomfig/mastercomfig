# Update

When a new release comes out, check out the
[latest release](https://mastercomfig.com/download) and
then download the latest files and drag them into your `tf/custom` folder,
replacing the old files.

This config gets updates frequently, so to get the latest improvements, make
sure you check here for new releases frequently, or you can get notifications
about updates on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/CuPb2zV),
[Steam Group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/comfig) (or its Steam Chat) or the
[teamfortress.tv thread](https://www.teamfortress.tv/42867/mastercomfig-fps-customization-config).
