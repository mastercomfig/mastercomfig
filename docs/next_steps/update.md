# Update

When a new release comes out, check out the [latest release](https://mastercomfig.com/download) and then download the latest files and drag them into your `tf/custom` folder, replacing the old files.

There may be extra steps listed in the changelog for that release (for example, new launch options), so make sure you stay up to date with the changes to mastercomfig.

This config gets updates frequently, so to get the latest improvements, make sure you check here for new releases frequently, or you can get notifications about updates on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/CuPb2zV), [Steam Group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/comfig), or its [Steam Chat](https://s.team/chat/IM8fJTnx).
